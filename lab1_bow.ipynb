       " 'From: porges@beretta.camb.inmet.com (Don Porges)\\nSubject: Re: JFFO has gone a bit too far\\nNntp-Posting-Host: beretta\\nOrganization: Intermetrics Inc.\\nDistribution: usa\\nLines: 80\\n\\n\\nHaving read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:\\n\\n1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \"verbatim \\ntranslation\" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --\\nthe book they\\'re talking about -- they compare the two things section\\nby section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.\\nIn the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce \\nthe German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not \\nsurprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a \\nsingle idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi\\nlaw; and sure enough, that\\'s what the whole thing has mutated into, \\nurban-folklore style.\\n\\n2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a \\ncopy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution \\nteam or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don\\'t \\nunderstand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable \\nto imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and \\nyet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:\\n\\n\"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons\\nLaw during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of\\ndocuments, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German\\nlaw registry].\"\\n\\nBingo.  Exactly.  \\n\\nDodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one\\nunder discussion.  All of the stuff about \"Why would a U.S. congressman\\nhave a copy of a Nazi law?\" melts away, by the author\\'s admission.  He\\nthen continues:  \"But if he acquired the original German text of the \\nNazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so \\nfor a very specific reason...\"  But there\\'s absolutely no reason to \\nthink that this is the case.  In fact, as a \"senior member of the U.S. \\nteam that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\", it seems to me that\\nhe would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether \\nthe Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously\\nis, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally\\nprosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red \\nherrings.\\n\\n3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the\\nJPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he \\nasked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge \\nlevelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask \\nto have things translated when they *don\\'t know what they mean*.  If Dodd \\ntook it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing \\nit into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, \\nwouldn\\'t he?\\n    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier\\nposting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this\\npurpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent\\non disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil\\nliberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn\\'t they have any idea how to do it\\non their own?\\n    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his\\nown question: \"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law\\nto show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the \\nNazi law.\"  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered\\ninto the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \"concerning\\nthe history of Nazism and gun confiscation\", Dodd\\'s motivation isn\\'t a \\nmystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.\\n\\n4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that\\nwas added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  \\nRegistration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT\\na \"Nazi-inspired\" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the \\n1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification \\nof certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list \\nother parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;\\nof course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,\\nin a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the \\ndiscussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, \\n\"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA\\'68...\" -- so \\nas to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t-- Don Porges\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tporges@inmet.camb.inmet.com\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t..uunet!inmet!porges\\n',\n",

How would the city law apply to your impending \\n|trial for the shooting?\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident\\nin Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a\\nhandgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand,\\na black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend\\nhimself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA\\nDirector who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided\\nnot to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs\\nhas it\\'s own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his\\nhouse, and told him: \"this is stepping over the line; this could get\\ndangerous for you.\" Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers\\nwatched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief\\nand his anti-gun cronies wouldn\\'t f*ck with him, his home or family.\\n\\n|Also, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled\\n|shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, \\n|either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  \\n\\nL.V.

I think an unshielded nuclear\\nwarhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.\\n\\nAs for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince\\nis required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in\\na dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private\\nownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must\\nbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe\\ncondition. If any random private citizen could not properly\\nkeep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation\\nis clearly appropriate.\\n\\n>>  Plus these things have no self-\\n>>defense purposes.

If you look at the American \\nrevolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves\\nfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They\\ndidn\\'t overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for \\nexample) that didn\\'t defend themselves were still under that same\\nold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and\\ndestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.\\nBut their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren\\'t suited\\nfor that.\\n\\nThere is also the question of personal and collective arms: The\\nSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personal\\nweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members\\nto provide their own arms.) But it isn\\'t clear if it covers\\nother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)\\na tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)\\nshould. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a \\ndisproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.\\nThe militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely\\ndemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only\\n50% would respond to a muster, and the militia\\'s firepower would\\nbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular\\nwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the\\nmembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the\\nform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia\\'s\\nfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not\\nof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite\\ndifferent from the general public (at the very least, they\\nwould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and\\ncharacter of the militia requires that each member provide\\na roughly equal share of the militia\\'s firepower: His personal\\nweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad\\'s heavier firepower.\\n\\n                                                  Frank Crary\\n                                                  CU Boulder\\n\\n',\n",

This\\n>also means that Christ had all of the legal rights of a decendant of\\n>David as according to at least Roman law (and possibly Mosaic law as\\n>well, but I am not sure) Joseph was Christ\\'s LEGAL FATHER.\\n\\nThe argument for Luke\\'s genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According\\nto Luke 3:23\\n\\n   And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about \\n   thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,\\n   the son of Eli,\\n\\nAside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible\\ninterpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.\\nClearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son\\nof Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man\\nto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at\\nstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no\\nintention of tracing Mary\\'s genealogy (in which case he would have\\nnamed her) but that he traces her husband\\'s, from David\\'s son Nathan.\\n\\nThe Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David\\'s\\nson, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:\\n\\n   And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born\\n   Jesus, who is called Christ. \\n\\nThere are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the\\ntwo paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David,\\nSolomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph\\nrelavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was\\nnot Jesus\\'s physical father, then the original poster is quite\\ncorrect, that claims for Jesus\\'s messianic heritage are not based on\\ntruth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus\\'s divine nature was.\\n\\nThe second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not\\ninvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy\\nSpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also\\ncapable of employing the physical agency of Joseph\\'s seed in this\\nwork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss\\nsolely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of\\npurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that\\nneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they\\nhad not \"known\"each other).  Thus the first gospel\\'s dedication of\\nhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant\\nto Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.\\n\\nTo the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more\\nproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating \\nthe births of two entirely different children of two entirely different\\nsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and \\nthe birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two \\nstories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years\\nlater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his\\nexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge\\nwith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his\\nresolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external\\ndocuments, and the discussion of \"how this could be\" might bring us beyond\\nthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the\\ndetails are described in Steiner\\'s \"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human \\nBeing and of Humanity\", \"The Gospel of St. Luke\", and \"The Gospel of St.\\nMatthew\". \\n\\nWhether or not Rudolf Steiner\\'s methods and explanation are accepted\\nas valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent\\ncontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.\\n\\nAs for the passing of one\\'s Jewishness through the mother, this was\\nnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary\\'s\\nJewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal\\nline of descent from David, the king.\\n\\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n',\n",

In comparison, in \\nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \\ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \\ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \\nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. \\n     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \\nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \\nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \\n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \\n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \\nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \\nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \\nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \\nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \\nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \\nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \\ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). \\n     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \\nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \\nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \\noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \\nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \\nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. \\n     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \\nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \\nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \\nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \\ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \\nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \\n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \\nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \\nrespectively). \\n     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \\nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \\nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \\nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \\n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \\nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). \\n     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \\nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \\nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \\nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \\nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \\n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \\n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \\nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \\n\\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \\nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health. JM Douglas, MD, \\nDenver Dept of Health and Hospitals. Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \\nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \\nPrevention Svcs, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \\nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \\ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \\nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \\ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \\nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \\nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \\nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \\ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. \\n     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \\nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \\nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \\n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \\ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \\nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \\npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \\n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \\ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \\nand gang affiliation. \\n     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \\nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \\n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \\ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \\ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \\nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. \\n     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \\ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \\npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \\nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \\nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \\nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \\nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \\nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \\ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \\nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \\nand health-care providers. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \\nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \\nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \\nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \\nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \\ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \\noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \\nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \\naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \\nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \\nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \\nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \\nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \\n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \\nstudy. \\n     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \\n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \\nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \\nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \\n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \\nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \\nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \\nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \\nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \\nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \\nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \\nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \\nby p values of less than 0.05. \\n     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \\n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \\nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \\nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \\nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \\nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \\nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \\nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \\nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \\nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \\nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \\n(no-law states). \\n     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \\nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \\nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \\ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \\n43.2%, respectively). \\n     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \\nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \\nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \\nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \\n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \\nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \\nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \\nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \\nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \\ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). \\n     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \\nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \\nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \\nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \\nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \\n\\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \\nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \\nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \\nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \\nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \\nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \\nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). \\n     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \\nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \\nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \\neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \\nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \\nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \\ndirected at parents with young children. \\n     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \\naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \\nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \\nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \\nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \\nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \\nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \\nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \\nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

The \\nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \\nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \\nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. \\n     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \\nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \\nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \\ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \\nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \\nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \\ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. \\n     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \\ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \\nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \\nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \\npool, or random variation. \\n     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \\ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \\nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \\nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Throughout the season increases in the indices \\nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \\nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \\nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \\nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \\n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \\nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \\nA(H1N1). \\n     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \\ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \\nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \\namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. \\n     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \\nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \\ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \\nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \\nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \\nAuthors: Louisa E.

Together, \\nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \\ntechnology (ART) procedures. \\n\\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \\npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \\nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \\nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \\n\\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \\nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \\nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \\nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \\nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \\ntraditional therapies. \\n\\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \\nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \\nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \\n\\no in vitro \\no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \\n  transfer \\no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \\nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \\ntowards improved success of these technologies. \\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n                           Future Areas of Research\\n\\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \\nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \\ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \\ndisease. \\n\\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \\nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \\namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \\n\\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \\nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \\nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \\nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \\nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \\nsex-linked disorders. \\n\\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \\nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \\nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \\nof affected children. \\n\\n\\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\\nCollege of Medicine \\nUniversity of Arizona\\nTucson, Arizona\\n\\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the\\n                           Management of Infertility\\n\\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \\nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \\n\\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \\nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \\nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \\nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \\nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \\nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \\nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \\nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \\nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \\nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \\nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \\nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \\nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \\negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \\nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \\nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  \\n     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \\ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \\nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \\nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \\ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \\nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. \\n     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \\ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \\nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \\nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \\novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \\nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \\nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \\nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \\ntraditional therapies. \\n     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \\nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \\navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \\nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \\nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \\nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \\nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \\nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \\nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \\nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \\nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \\nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \\nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \\n\\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \\nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \\nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \\ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \\noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \\nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \\ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \\npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \\nand/or idiopathic infertility.    \\n     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \\nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \\nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \\npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \\nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \\nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \\nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \\npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \\na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \\ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \\nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \\nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. \\n     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \\nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \\nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \\ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. \\n     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \\nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \\nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \\nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \\nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \\nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \\nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \\nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. \\n     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \\nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \\nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \\ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \\npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \\nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \\nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \\nthrough enzymatic digestion. \\n     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \\npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \\nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \\nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \\nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \\nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \\noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \\nestablish conception. \\n\\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\\nCollege of Medicine \\n--------- end of part 2 ------------\\n\\n---\\n      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165\\n      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15\\n                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na\\n\",\n",

The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by\\n3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it\\nwasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he\\nincreased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps. \\n\\n   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know\\nwhat model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime\\ncould play back at the same speed even on an LCII.\\n\\n   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having\\na little bit of trouble.

In my\\nencounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their\\nbelief that their faith is total truth.  According to them,\\ntheir beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of\\nGod and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance\\nmakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own\\nhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.\\nTheir way is the \\'truth.\\'\\n\\nBut I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe\\na particular way.

I\\ncan understand criticisms of Christianity that say there\\'s not enough\\nevidence to believe it, or that there\\'s just as good evidence for\\nother religions.  I don\\'t agree, but clearly there are plenty of\\nintelligent people who don\\'t find the evidence convincing.  But that\\ndoesn\\'t seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who\\nbelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict\\nit are false.\\n\\nThis suggests a model of spiritual things that\\'s rather different than\\nthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where\\npeople choose what value to follow, but there\\'s no actual independent\\nspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in\\nsome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of\\none sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But\\nChristianity is in its essense a \"historical\" religion.  That is, it\\'s\\nbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out\\nthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,\\nand that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \"mundane\" world,\\nwe are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it\\nfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn\\'t).  The\\nChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual\\nexternal reality.  I hope we\\'re all honest enough not to claim that we\\nhave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know\\neverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that\\nimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.

Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs!

Smith, D.D.\\n                              (1894-1977)\\n\\n          When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about\\n     Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:\\n\\n                 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son\\n               of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief\\n               priests and unto the scribes, and they shall\\n               condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him\\n               to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and\\n               to crucify Him; and the third day He shall\\n               rise again\" (Matthew 20:18-19).\\n\\n          Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,\\n     who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving\\n     reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He\\n     knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious\\n     leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that\\n     one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual\\n     death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly\\n     how He would die--*by crucifixion.*\\n\\n          All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the\\n     minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted\\n     would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise\\n     again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.\\n\\n          But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-\\n     tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-\\n     tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.\\n\\n          The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth\\n     between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and\\n     ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which\\n     had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against\\n     the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had\\n     predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and\\n     on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the\\n     disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some\\n     of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the\\n     tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,\\n     they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back\\n     to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus\\' friends, Peter and\\n     John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the\\n     tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came\\n     hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them\\n     to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).\\n\\n          How did this tomb become empty?\\n\\n          One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--\\n     professor of New Testament literature in a large theological\\n     seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*\\n     the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by\\n     bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb\\n     became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the\\n     chimney at Christmas time.\\n\\n          But he didn\\'t realize that Santa Clause never did come down\\n     any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa\\n     Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the\\n     tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.\\n\\n          Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-\\n     bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by\\n     mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.\\n\\n          Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,\\n     tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar\\n     in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)\\n     that the women went to the wrong tomb.\\n\\n          The facts are these:\\n\\n          First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to\\n     which by mistake they could have gone.\\n\\n          Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or\\n     more people to forget the place where they have buried their\\n     dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women\\n     did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to\\n     the wrong tomb?\\n\\n          Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?\\n\\n          There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the\\n     evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.\\n\\n                  Now when they were going, behold, some\\n               of the watch came into the city and showed\\n               unto the chief priests all the things that\\n               were done.  And when they were assembled\\n               with the leaders and had taken counsel, they\\n               gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,\\n               Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole\\n               Him away while we slept.  And if this come to\\n               the governor\\'s ears, we will persuade him, and\\n               secure you.  So they took the money, and did\\n               as they were taught:  and this saying is com-\\n               monly reported among the Jews until this day\\n               (Matthew 28:11-15).\\n\\n          This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the\\n     fact that the tomb was empty.\\n\\n          You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never\\n     questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to\\n     see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.\\n\\n          Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that\\n     the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus\\' disciples\\n     came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*\\n\\n          How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?\\n     Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.\\n\\n          Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject\\n     the explanation, the very character and the later history of the\\n     disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away\\n     the body of Jesus.\\n\\n          First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in\\n     Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to\\n     contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His\\n     resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there\\n     had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,\\n     then proved.\\n\\n          Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would\\n     have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.\\n     It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most\\n     of these men did.\\n\\n          The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ\\n     had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it\\n     would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed\\n     pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing\\n     humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today\\n     as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.\\n\\n          But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to\\n     leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to\\n     what had happened to Him.\\n\\n          Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.\\n\\n          He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning\\n     (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-\\n     18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He\\n     walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that\\n     night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper\\n     room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).\\n\\n          A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at\\n     the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren\\n     on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the\\n     apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-\\n     8).\\n\\n          As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-\\n     ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed\\n     attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are\\n     unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the\\n     unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the\\n     appearances.\\n\\n          Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our\\n     leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are\\n     antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest\\n     thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.\\n     Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;\\n     Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of\\n     Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president\\n     of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.\\n\\n          But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has\\n     it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:\\n     it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.\\n\\n          Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He\\n     claimed to have come down *from* God.\\n\\n          He said He was the way *to* God.\\n\\n          He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.\\n\\n          He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one\\n     else had it.\\n\\n          He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to\\n     us.\\n\\n          Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed\\n     that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*\\n\\n          Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe\\n     that His words are all true?\\n\\n          The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us\\n     that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?\\n\\n          And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead\\n     testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some\\n     day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.\\n\\n          In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all\\n     this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For\\n     He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-\\n     ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a\\n     hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.\\n\\n          Those who have tried it down through the ages--*and there have been\\n     many*--have given their testimony.  And we today who believe also know.\\n',\n",

Then they may be able to\\ncrowd out \"garbage genes.\" This may in the future become possible. Even if\\nit does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully\\nmean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy\\nlater. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa\\nand for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We\\ndon\\'t really know what the future may hold for our environment. The\\nreduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred\\ndomesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age,\\nmeteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc.,\\netc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible\\navailable is a good strategy for species survival. \\n \\nOf course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out\\nas no different than anyone else\\'s. But if we could make\\n\"philosopher-kings\" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they)\\nwant to give them elevated status? We could.

Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen\\nto persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing\\nnew under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before\\n\"1984.\"   \\n \\nI see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2\\nproblems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to\\nuse any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That\\nhasn\\'t stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which\\nhave died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also\\nmany are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own\\npower.

Nuclear power or global\\nwarming or whatever could and may still do that, too. \\n \\nThe real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don\\'t think\\nman has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any\\nbetter than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we\\nmay not. If we don\\'t, I hope there are reservoirs of \"garbage\" people out\\nin some backwater with otherwise long discarded \"garbage\" genes which will\\npull us through. \\n \\nI believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same.\\nMan needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his\\nlacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have,\\nand I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God\\nin their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue\\nneeded to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have\\ndied out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough\\ninput from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed\\nthemselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the\\nones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit\\nto use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes\\nthus far, or else haven\\'t had enough power for long enough. \\n \\nIn summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new\\ntechnology is really an ancient one.

God then cannot ask for anything but  \\npunishement for those sins.

Today he\\nsmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique\\nI'd never seen before.\\n\\nHe took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil.\\nThe tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray,\\nmade by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.\\n\\nIn the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar\\nquantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two\\nteabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.\\n\\nOn top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with\\ntwo chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly\\nwent on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.\\n\\nLater, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises\\nand concerns me are:\\n\\n1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?\\n\\n2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color\\n    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring\\n    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected\\n    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,\\n    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being\\n    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?\\n\\n3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated\\n    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract\\n    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever\\n    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea\\n    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do\\n    so.\\n\\nWRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens),\\nI've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy\\ntaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently\\nstopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips,\\ngetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process,\\nthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.\\n\\nMy theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight\\nstuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort\\nof larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after\\nthe initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,\\njust leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?\\n\\nI also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping\\non the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because\\nit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill\\nnon-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this\\nduck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals\\nat one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the\\nfloor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire\\nin that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.\\n\\nAnd yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that\\nsmoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains\\nnitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually\\nhas some standing, don't know about the others.\\n\\nAn amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal, when it was\\ndiscovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were putting\\na lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevils.\\nThis is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic.\\nThe guy who represented the company in the press conference defended\\nhimself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day\\nfor a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal-\\nbroiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that, my\\nimmediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!  One charcoal\\nbroiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans!\\n\",\n",

The message of \"praying in Jesus\\' name\" is thus closely\\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God\\'s\\ndelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\\nresponsibilities.  This idea of praying \"in Jesus\\' name\" is not only\\npresent but prominent in the Lord\\'s Prayer, although the verbal\\nforumula is absent.\\n\\nThe act of praying the words \"In Jesus\\' Name\" may be beneficial if\\nthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the\\nadvancement of God\\'s Kingdom.

This\\nshould be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando\\nFlorida  are any indicator.

Second, the historical\\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \\nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius\\'s\\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\\na la Chalcedon.\\n\\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\\nthat Jesus\\'s human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\\nprevailed.\\n\\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\\n\\nJason Albert\\n\\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn\\'t see how we could call\\nJesus fully human, because he didn\\'t sin.  I completely agree that\\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\\n\\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there\\'s reason to think\\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\\ngot the better of them.\\n\\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\\nmust be understood that there\\'s a certain indirectness in the Logos\\'\\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don\\'t have an\\nincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white\\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\\narea.\\n\\nYou say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus\\'s\\nhuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don\\'t think that\\'s required by\\northodox doctrine.  It\\'s the divine Logos that is eternal.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

I've\\nrefrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with\\nthe OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say\\nsomething.\\n\\nMany things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest\\nsuggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the\\nGospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death\\nof Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break\\ndown these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there\\nis neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If\\nMoslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill\\nthem.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions.\\nThere are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under\\nattack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are\\nliving together peacefully.\\n\\nThe precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two\\ndifferent things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into\\nCanaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have\\npromised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be\\na holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those\\nattacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be\\ndefeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in\\nJoshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was\\npossible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once\\nthat was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were\\nexpected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of\\nagreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted\\nBosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior\\nwould have disqualified this from being a holy war.\\n\\nThe other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by\\nAssyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel\\nfor her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a\\njudgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay\\nof the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because\\nillness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God\\nfor good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't\\njustify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that\\nin attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as\\n*unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's\\npeople, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were\\nactually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action.\\nFurthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are\\njudgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through\\nhis prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to\\nBosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting,\\nI am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that\\ndoesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from\\njudgement.\\n\\nI am particularly concerned about the implications of this issue\\nbecause of current tensions between the West and Moslem-oriented\\nnations.  What we do not need is for Moslems to conclude that\\nChristians think it's OK to kill Moslems.  The implications for the\\nmid-East, and even relations with American Moslems, could be quite\\nserious.\\n\",\n",

This is in response to a question about\\nthe Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification\\nup to our Catholic readers.  --clh]\\n\\nThere is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the\\nmention of Mary\\'s _blessedness_/full of grace in the \"Annunciation\" by\\nAngel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28\\n\\n And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto\\n a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a\\n man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin\\'s\\n name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\"Hail,\\n thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed\\n art thou among women.\"_\\n\\nNow, now, hold that line of thought - \"the Lord is with Mary &\\nblessed art thou among women\" - while you read on....\\n\\nIn the book, \"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of\\nDevotion to Mary\" by Peter Lappin:\\n\\nThe _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated\\nthan the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible\\nthat the feast of _Mary\\'s Conception_ under the title \"The Conception\\nof Saint Anne\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of\\na woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter,\\njust as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in\\nemphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle\\nof grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary\\nis the incorruptible timber \"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_\\nof Christ\\'s sinless body\"; she is \"God\\'s Eden, in whom there is\\nno tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\"  Her perfect\\nbeauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her\\npurity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus,\\nshe was hailed as \"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,\\nspotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from\\namong thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\".\\n...\\nAt the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,\\nJohn Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a \\ngreater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all\\nsin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_.\\n...\\n\\nNow let\\'s go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.\\nFrom \"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\" by John A. Hardon:\\n\\nBaptism -\\nConcupiscence Remains after Baptism.\\nConcupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized\\nbut since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to\\ninjure those who do not consent and who by the grace of\\nChrist Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).\\n\\nOriginal gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:\\nIn the light of the foregoing, we see that our first\\nparents were originally gifted three times over:\\n-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the\\n power to think and to choose freely.\\n-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality\\n and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.\\n-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,\\n the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding\\n title to enter heaven.\\nBy their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and\\npreternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without\\nlosing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose\\nfreely.\\n\\nBaptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam\\'s\\nsin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts\\nbut gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our\\nbodies on the last day...\\n\\nGoing back to _Immaculate Conception_\\n(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other\\nbooks but it may be another contribution to the \\'puzzle\\'):\\n\\nGiven the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a\\nnon-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born \\nAND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary\\'s birth but\\nSTILL, the Angel Gabriel\\'s greetings was:\\n\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.\\nBlessed art thou amongst women\".\\n\\nEven Mary was confused about this greeting.\\n\\nMary could very well have possessed all of the\\n_treefold original gifts above_ given to our first\\nparents (Adam and Eve before their sin):\\n    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)\\n    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)\\n    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would\\n                definitely want to be with those He\\n                has made _blessed_)\\n    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)\\n\\nAt the conception, God made Mary _full of grace\\nand blessed_ as the \\'tabernacle\\' for the coming body\\nof Christ and so,\\n\\nImmaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still\\nhas maintained her Immaculate Heart. \\n\\n-Marida\\n(P.S.

Every\\n|day when I go out to lunch I always see cops coming in.  The majority that I\\n|see are still carrying revolvers.  Not that there is anything wrong with a\\n|revolver but if you\\'re a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple\\n|of automatics in his coat (I mean semi-auto handguns) you\\'re going to be at a\\n|disadvantage even with training.  I have been at a shooting range where gang\\n|gang members were \"practicing\" shooting.  They were actually practicing\\n|taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target\\n|and they weren\\'t doing too badly either.   The University cops here (who are\\n|are state cops) are armed better than the Chicago police.  It seems most\\n|state cops are.  I don\\'t know where you are originally from David but you live\\n|in Tennesse and I live in Chicago and see this crap everyday on the news\\n|and in the papers.  I think the situation is just a tad different here\\n|than there.\\n\\nHowever, don\\'t forget that the police in Chicago can carry just about\\nanything they want except for the Glock, which is not approved for\\ncarry (Guess they figure all cops are like the Police Chief of Winnetka,\\nwho happened to let off a stray round of 9mm. This is the same anti-gun\\npolice chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars...).\\n\\nPerhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago\\'s finest, a close-to-\\n100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable\\nautomatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto\\nhandgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers.\\n\\nI don\\'t think the issue is cost, because Chicago police certainly make\\non the order of at least $40K/year. \\n\\nYour presumption of \"disadvantage\" I think is not borne out by the\\nexperiences of New York City\\'s cops; there the cops usually come out\\non top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen S&Ws, Rugers and Beretta 9mms in addition to the revolvers\\ncarried by Chicago cops.... in the past, I\\'ve seen .45 M1911s; others\\nhave seen Browning Hi-Powers...\\n\\n|Jason\\n',\n",

Paul thought it was.  Paul said, \\n\"Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.\"\\n\\nToday, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of\\nit is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don\\'t tell people anymore, that\\nthere\\'s such a thing as sin or that there\\'s such a place as hell.  \\n\\nAs Jayne has said, this doesn\\'t mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit\\npeople over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a\\nplace called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to\\nexperience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we\\ncan to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going\\nto \"outer darkness.\".  \\n\\nJesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn\\'t prepare hell for people.  He prepared\\nit for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere,\\nthat God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the\\nelect are the \"whosoever will\" and the nonelect are the \"whosoever wont\\'s.\" \\nWhether or not that\\'s theologically sound, I couldn\\'t defend, but its\\npractical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, \"Ye would not.\"  \\n\\nNow, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be\\nChristians.  Have you ever said to somebody, \"I don\\'t believe in hell.  I\\nbelieve in the religion of Jesus.\"  But did you know that Jesus talked more\\nabout hell than He did about heaven!  \"Oh I believe in the religion of the\\nsermon on the mount.\"  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the\\nmount.  You\\'ll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire. \\nSeveral times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over\\nin the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah. \\nNot Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God. \\nThe great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn\\'t\\nwant to see them go there.\\n\\nNow, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus,\\nnot some angry Baptist preacher, that said, \"where the worm never dies, and\\nwhere the fire never goes out.\"  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell\\na \"furnace of fire.\"  It was Jesus that used the word, \"condemnation.\"  \"And\\nthis is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because\\ntheir deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.  \\n\\nHow can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?\\n Not only that, but He went through hell.  That\\'s what Calgary was all about. \\nWhen my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, \"outer\\ndarkness.\"  \\n\\nDo you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over\\nhere, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are\\nprostituting their bodies over there?  That\\'s not what hell is.  Hell\\'s not a\\nparty.  There\\'s no fellowship there.  He called it \"outer darkness.\"  \"Outer\"\\n-away from God.  \"Darkness\" -God is light.  \\n\\nNo when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated\\nJesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That\\'s is a sobering thought.  As my\\nson would say, an \"awesome\" thought.  \\n\\n\"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?\"  Hell is isolation.  There\\'s no\\nfellowship in hell.  There\\'s no friendship in hell.  There\\'s no loving embrace\\nin hell.  There\\'s no hand shake in hell.  There\\'s no word of encouragement in\\nhell.  \\n\\n\"I thirst.\"  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving\\nwith no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it\\neternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman\\'s body, will\\ncrave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way\\nand I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of\\nenvironment that matches the internal condition of the lost.  \\n\\nIn a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life\\nministries.  I\\'ve remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the\\nillustration that I gave wasn\\'t his.  His illustration was that he was talking\\nto his barber and his barber\\'s wife and daughter had just recently been saved\\nand he was commenting about it to Jack.  \"They sing these songs and read Bible\\nverses, and their praising this and that -I can\\'t stand it!  Jack, do you think\\nGod would send me to hell?\"  Jack answered by saying, \"Yes I think he would!\" \\nOf course the barber said, \"What do you mean by that.\"  \"Well if you can\\'t\\nstand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to\\nGod now, what would you do in heaven where they\\'ll do it for eternity?  You\\'d\\nbe miserable.  Because God loves you, He\\'d put you where it would match what\\nyou really are.\"   It makes a man think.\\n\\nThe crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal\\nexistence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don\\'t ask\\nme how, I don\\'t know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He\\ndied, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He\\npurchased eternal life for the \"whosoever wills.\"  He suffered eternal\\njudgment.  \\n\\nA lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying \"Everybody is going\\nto be saved eventually.\"  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He\\'ll separate\\nthem.  The sheep from the goats.  \".After you die there\\'s a probationary period\\nin which God prepares you for heaven.\"  No, my Bible says that \"It is appointed\\nunto men once to die and then comes judgment.\"  Some of the cultist believe in\\nannihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you\\'re squished\\nout.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as\\nthere is in heaven.  \\n\\nI don\\'t enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don\\'t enjoy\\nlistening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a\\nplace called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any\\nhope that people aren\\'t going there, I\\'d give it to you, but I haven\\'t found\\nit.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a\\nGod of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of\\ncreatures we are and therefore we\\'re responsible, the fact that He has placed\\nus in a \"uni\"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is\\nsuch an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us\\nfrom hell leads us to two applications.\\n\\n1)  As I\\'ve already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others. \\nIts not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just\\naround the bend the bridge is out.  \"Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we\\npersuade men.\"\\n\\n2)  If you haven\\'t accepted Jesus are your Savior, you\\'re taking an awful\\nchance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if\\nyou are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die\\nand cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and\\nsuffer eternal damnation.  I don\\'t mean to make fun at this point, but its like\\nDirty Harry said, \"You\\'ve got to ask yourself, \\'Do I feel lucky?\\'  Well do\\nyou?\"  \"A man\\'s got to know his limitations.\"  Don\\'t be one of the \"whosoever\\nwont\\'s.\"  \\n\\n\"Because while I was yet a sinner, He died for me.\"\\n\"There\\'s no greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for another.\"\\n--Rex\\n \\n',\n",

Blue which are words that were \\nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \\nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn\\'t think it converted \\ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \\ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \\nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \\ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \\nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \\n\\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \\nprocessor formats.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \\nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \\nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \\nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \\nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \\nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \\ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \\nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \\nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \\ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \\nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \\nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \\nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \\neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \\n(3). \\n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \\nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \\nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \\npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \\nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \\n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \\nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \\nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \\ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \\npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \\nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \\n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \\n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \\nwas initiated. \\n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \\nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \\ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \\n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \\nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \\nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \\nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \\na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \\nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \\ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \\n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \\n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \\nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \\n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \\nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \\n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \\n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \\nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \\nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \\nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \\nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \\nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \\nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \\n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \\npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \\nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \\n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \\noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \\npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \\nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \\nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \\ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \\nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \\nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \\nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \\n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \\nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \\nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \\ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \\ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \\nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \\nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \\nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \\nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \\none patient 38 days after illness onset. \\n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \\nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \\n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \\nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \\nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \\nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \\n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \\nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \\n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \\nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \\nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \\nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \\n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \\n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \\nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \\nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \\nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \\nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \\n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \\nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \\n\\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \\nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \\nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \\nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \\nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children\\'s Hospital and \\nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \\nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has since \\nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \\ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \\nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \\nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \\nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \\nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \\nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \\nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \\nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \\n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \\nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \\nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \\n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \\nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \\ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \\ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \\nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \\n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \\noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \\nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \\nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \\n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \\npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \\nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \\nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \\nhealth action to prevent further cases. \\n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \\ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \\nDepartment of Agriculture\\'s Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \\ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \\nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \\nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \\npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \\nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \\ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \\nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \\nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \\nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \\nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \\n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \\n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \\nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \\nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \\noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \\nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \\ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \\ncoli O157:H7. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Long-term use of \\nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \\noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \\ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \\nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \\nCDC\\'s 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \\nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \\ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \\nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \\nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \\n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \\ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \\nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \\nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \\nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \\ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \\nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \\ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \\nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \\nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \\nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \\nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \\nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \\nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \\nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \\nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \\n(3). \\n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \\nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \\nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \\nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \\nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \\nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan \\nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \\nIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was \\nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \\nrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \\nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). \\n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \\naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \\nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although \\nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \\namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \\n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \\nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \\nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \\naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \\n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \\nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \\nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \\n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \\n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \\ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \\nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \\nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \\n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \\n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\\n49.6). \\n\\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \\nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \\nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \\ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \\nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \\nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \\nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \\nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \\nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \\n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \\nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \\nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \\nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \\nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \\ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \\n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \\nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \\nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \\nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \\nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \\nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \\nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \\nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \\n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \\npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \\ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \\n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \\nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \\nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \\ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \\nenforcing laws that restrict minors\\' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \\ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \\nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \\nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \\ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven\\non the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of\\noriginal sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the\\nconnection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace\\nbased on Godism.  The messiah\\'s teachings will build on the foundation\\nof the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God,\\nthe fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God\\'s providence of\\nrestoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all\\nthe World\\'s religions.\\n\\nMany Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may\\nmiss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000\\nyears ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish\\npeople of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that\\nJohn the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was\\nElijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even\\nquestioned who Jesus was: \"is he the one who is to come or do we look\\nfor another\".

What sets a Messiah apart is\\nthat he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but\\nachieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born\\nsinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God\\nthousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God\\noriginally intended.  God\\'s restoration providence is still not\\ncomplete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God\\'s\\nrepresentative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one\\nGod.\\n\\n> [Mark 13:21   And then if any one says to you, \\'Look, here is the Christ!\\' \\n> or \\'Look, there he is!\\' do not believe it. \\n...\\n> Mark 13:26   And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with \\n> great power and glory. \\n\\n> My understanding of Jesus\\' answer is that, unlike his first coming,\\n> which was veiled, the second coming will be quite unmistakeable.\\n\\n> By the way, from Koresh\\'s public statement it\\'s not so clear to me\\n> that he is claiming to be Christ.\\n\\nWho else in this world is claiming to be the Messiah.

While most\\n  leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the \\n  economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area\\n  of jobs creation.\\n\\n  The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,\\n  in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed\\n  a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting\\n  economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.\\n\\n  Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.\\n  \"It\\'s the guns\" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other\\n  \"gun-nuts\" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the\\n  economy out of the recession.  \"Their buying them five times faster than\\n  ever before, and stockpiling left and right\", the Vice President said.  \\n\\n  However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have\\n  been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several\\n  declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have\\n  not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.\\n\\n  \"We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people\", said\\n  the President of Colt industries.  \"As long as Clinton is in office, we\\n  suspect it will\", he added.\\n\\n  In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new\\n  Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It\\'s \\n  called the \"Ban-One-A-Month\" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,\\n  every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index \\n  cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw\\n  one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any\\n  further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the\\n  politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.\\n\\n  The President said, \"This law will benefit America two ways.  When the\\n  Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run\\n  out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,\\n  over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the\\n  street.\"  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee\\n  this program, citing her \"Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject\\n  of gun control\".\\n\\n  Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an\\n  amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing\\n  caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  \"Their stockpiling,\\n  stockpiling, stockpiling\" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference\\n  at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.\\n\\n  Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment\\n  that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been\\n  drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, \"First we\\'ll\\n  fuck em, then we\\'ll kick em out of bed in the morning\", during a press\\n  conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate\\n  building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow\\n  the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require\\n  the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,\\n  after all of the cards have been drawn.\\n\\n  The head of the BATF responded by saying, \"We will have to see if this\\n  thing in Waco is over by then.

There is no question that\\norally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all\\nneurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median\\neminence. These areas are responsible for the production of\\nhormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal\\ndevelopment of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now\\nwhat, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain\\nnecessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing?\\nAre you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary,\\nANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for\\ncontrolling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone? \\n\\nHow do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It\\'s unethical to\\n\"sacrifice\" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses\\nof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food\\nindustry knows this. That\\'s why the animal model is used in medicine\\nand psych.  If you\\'re talking about straight sensitivity, it would be\\nuseful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on\\npsychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and\\nphysiology.\\n\\nI suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities\\n(You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its\\nimplication for adults (me).  Certainly\\nthe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than\\nfor the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious\\nand increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their\\nhidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone\\nwant to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the\\nendocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels*\\nattained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC. \\n\\n>>Between who? Over what?

This\\ndoesn\\'t mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in\\nthe Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.\\n\\n  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should\\naddress this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like\\nit or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,\\nand isn\\'t.  \\n  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has\\nforgotten.  This doesn\\'t mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we\\nhave something to learn from the pagan movement.\\n  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of\\noppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to\\nlive in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ \\ncould have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great\\ndeal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the \\nmale-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have\\nhad to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.\\n  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great\\nramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings\\nand our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long\\ntradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress\\nand deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human\\nexperience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  \\nChristianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism\\nis an attractive option.\\n  I\\'m not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)\\nshould be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of\\nsexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated\\nsexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\\n\\nAlan Terlep\\t\\t\\t\\t    \"Incestuous vituperousness\"\\nOakland University, Rochester, MI\\t\\t\\t\\natterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu\\t\\t\\t\\t   --Melissa Eggertsen\\nRushing in where angels fear to tread.\\t\\t\\n',\n",

It\\'s one\\nof those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.\\nWhat Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I\\'m sure, is that when people\\nread this they think violent arguments where one member of the family\\ngrabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation\\nwhich could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or\\na tragic accident, especially involving a child.\\n\\n       Unfortunately, that\\'s not the way things stack up.  The majority\\nof that 43 \"times\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone \\nintentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill \\nthemselves.  And why it\\'s popular to try and blame suicides on guns,\\nthe evidence doesn\\'t support this.  Internal studies, as well as\\ncomparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural\\nfactors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.\\n(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There\\npeople jump off buildings.)\\n\\n       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime\\nis commited by \"non-strangers,\" which mistakenly has been generalized\\nregarding the King County study to mean, \"Friends and family.\"  That\\nis, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on\\nthe mental image that a \"Friend, family member, or child,\" equates\\nto a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of\\nanger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,\\nchildren assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by \\nsomeone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun\\nwas used against a \"friend\" or family member doesn\\'t mean they\\nweren\\'t trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among\\npoor urban families, and those are also the areas most \"at risk\"\\nfor family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may\\nnot be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban\\nkid might.\\n\\n       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the\\nonly value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I\\nworked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly\\nself-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.\\nBetween the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there\\'s an enormous\\namount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.\\nAs such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid\\nmeans of determining the success of such a defense, since according\\nto the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report\\ndefenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders\\nkilled.\\n\\n       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a \"friend\\nor family member\" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense\\nwhich occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in\\nbusinesses.)\\n\\n>Studies by the \\n>Western Psychiatric Institute, in Pittsburgh, found that the mere presence\\n>of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member\\n>will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness.\"\\n\\n       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can\\'t comment.  I\\nwill point out Canada\\'s and Japan\\'s suicide rate as indications that\\nculture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.\\n\\n       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what\\nit\\'s worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural\\nlines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the\\nexact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws \\nwould not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason.\\n Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)

It\\nis only because of God\\'s own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing. \\nYour logic comes to fruition in relativism.  \\n>\\n>\"At the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded.\"\\n>                                                    -- Ludwig Wittgenstein\\n\\nAh, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig\\'s fame is often\\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\\ncontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus\\n(\\'21) and Philosophical Investigation (\\'53).  Many of Witt\\'s comments and\\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\\nlanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt\\'s\\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features\\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt\\'s own\\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that\\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\\na threshold.\\n  vonWrights\\'s comment that Witt\\'s \"sentences have a content that often lies\\ndeep beneath the surface of language.\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the\\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\\nourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with\\nWitt\\'s own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \\nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\\n\\n  This is why John\\'s Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \"as a man thinketh, so\\nhe is.\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn\\'t shy from this, a mysticism to\\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\\nand it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy\\'s Sweetie\\'s conclusion because\\nif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  \\n\\n\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would\\nsay unto me.\"  Job 23ff\\n\\n--Rex\\n\\nsuggested, easy reading about epistimology:  \"He is there and He is not Silent\"\\n by Francis Schaeffer.\\n',\n",

I still believe\\nthat doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would\\nnot have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent\\nthe many hours in Stanford\\'s Med Library as I have done.\\nAnd 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that \\nwould help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank\\ngoodness I didn\\'t.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine\\nthat helps me.  \\n\\nI think that what you\\'ve said is kind of idealistic.  That you\\nwould go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second\\nopinion, and then move on with your life.\\nJust as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in \\nthis field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses.\\nThese are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over\\nthe country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going\\nto a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was \\nhelpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very\\nunproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research,\\nmake phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.\\n\\nA recent movie, Lorenzo\\'s Oil, offers a perfect example of what\\nI\\'m talking about.  If you haven\\'t seen it, you should.  It\\'s not\\na put down of doctor\\'s and neither is what I\\'m saying.  Doctors are\\nonly human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us\\nout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing\\npiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.\\n\\nI guess I\\'m biased because dizziness is one of those weird things\\nthat is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart,\\nor failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That\\'s because \\nthose things are much more tangible and have much more concise \\ndefinitions and treatments.

That is the \\nprime reason why the National Firearms Act is based on collecting revenue.\\nSince the Congress has the authority to levy taxes, the NFA is a tax act and\\nthe registration requirement within it is to assist in that tax collection.\\nU.S.C 922, in order to be constitutional, must have a basis on a particular\\nauthority granted to the Congress by the Constitution.  Congress can not\\narbitrarily ban a substance or product.  That is why prohibition came into\\neffect, only by passing an ammendment.   What you said about constitutionality\\nof law needs to be clarified.  I believe that an unconstitutional law was \\nnever constitutional.  When a law is determined by the Supreme Court, to be\\nunconstitutional, that law was never really a law.  The very nature of the law\\nbeing unconstitutional invalidates the law at it\\'s inception.  Please correct\\nme if I\\'m wrong, but when a law is deemed to be unconstitutional, anyone\\nconvicted of breaking that law is absolved.\\n   I don\\'t believe U.S.C 922 has ever been challenged in court.

When Big Government feels\\nit is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even\\nviolent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally\\nout of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war\\non its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,\\ngovernment of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the \\'lords\\' and other elites\\nwho want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn\\'t feel the\\nneed to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military\\nboot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced\\nthat it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances\\nredressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that\\nwill exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been\\nunresponsive or such acts wouldn\\'t be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse\\nto open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.\\nIts the old \\'might makes right\\' philosophy that is the hallmark of a\\ngovernment going rogue:  They don\\'t like it?

One would hear an explosion among many\\nexplosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000\\npound bomb or a tactical nuke.

And of\\nthe New Testament: Four books of the Gospel, One book of the Acts of the\\nApostles, Thirteen letters of Paul the Apostle, One Letter of the same\\nto the Hebrews, two of Peter the Apostle, Three of John, One of the\\nApostle Jude, One of the Apostle James, One book of the Apocalypse of\\nJohn.\"\\n\\t-Council of Hippo, Statute 36, (393 AD)\\n\\n\\tThis same list was promulgated again at the Third Council of Carthage\\n(397 AD), and at the Sixth Council of Carthage (419 AD) - at which\\ncouncil the same list was enumerated with the words \"Because we have\\nrecieved from the Fathers that these are the books to be read in the\\nChurch.\"  Which ought to quiet those who assert \"in the name of Holy\\nScripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was\\nnever any doubt in the Church,\" as the Episcopal Church does in removing\\nthe Deuterocanon from the realm of Scripture.  (Though the Episcopalians\\nhold them in high regard and read them in the Church, they are not\\ncounted as Scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma.  The\\nLutherans hold out similarly.)\\n\\tEarlier mention of the so-called Apocrypha as divine scripture can also\\nbe found, and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it\\ndivine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers.\\n\\n\"And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned as\\nconsisting of twenty-two books: so that they may correspond to the\\nnumber of letters [in the Hebrew alphabet].... It is to be noted also\\nthat by adding to these Tobias and Judith, there are twenty-four books,\\ncorresponding to the number of letters used by the Greeks.\"\\n\\t-St. Hillary of Poitiers, \"Commentaries on the Psalms,\" prologue, 15 (365 AD)\\n\\n\"The twenty-two books according to the Hebrews are .... Jeremiah, with\\nLamentations and the Letter, reckoned as one .... and [also] there is\\nMaccabees.\"\\n\\t-Origen, \"Commentaries on the Psalms,\" Psalm 1 (245 AD)\\n\\n\"Divine Scripture, addressing itself to those who love themselves and to\\nthe boastful .... says most excellently [Baruch 3.16-19 follows].\"\\n\\t-St. Clement of Alexandria, \"The Instuctor of Children,\" 2, 3, 36, 3, (203 AD)\\n\\n\"....I learned accurately the books of the Old Testament ... Proverbs of\\nSolomon, and also Wisdom ...\"\\n\\t-St. Melito of Sardes, fragment found in Eusebius\\' \"History of the\\nChurch,\" and dating from crica 177 AD, Book 4, 26, 14\\n\\n\"It is likewise decreed: Now, indeed, we must treat of the divine\\nScriptures: what the universal Catholic Church accepts and what she must\\nshun.  The list of the Old Testament .... Wisdom, one book;\\nEcclesiasticus, one book .... Tobit, one book .... Judith, one book; of\\nMaccabees, two books.\"\\n\\t-St. Damasus I, Pope, \"The Decree of Damsus,\" section 2 (382 AD)\\n\\n\\tI would think this enough, though more can be shown, that the Church\\nhas always accepted the deutero-canon, though parts have been disputed\\nby various persons.  For if disputes involving the New Testament\\ndeutero-canon does not disqulaify those books (i.e. Hebrews, James, 2\\nPeter, 2&3 John, Jude, Revelation) in Protestant eyes, than neither\\nshould it disqulaify the Old Testament books.  And I must point out that\\nthe Jews only drew up their canon in 90 AD, 60 years after the founding\\nof the Christian Religion upon the Cross.  Why should we adhere to a\\ncanon that was drawn up by the faithless, in reaction to the Chrsitian\\nuse of the Greek Septuagint, which includes the deutero-canon?  As early\\nas 150 AD, St. Justin had already accused the Jews of mutilating the\\nCanon of Scripture by their removal of certain books.  Protestants\\napparently prefer to think that God\\'s revelation was limited by a decree\\nof the Jews in the ordering of their (the Jews\\') faithless canon, and\\nthat he could not use other people, like the Apostles, in drawing up the\\ncanon.  The Apostles were most certain users of the Septuagint, as some\\n80% of the Old Testament quotes use the wording of the Septuagint, and\\nnot the Hebrew.  And the Septuagint includes the Deuterocanon.\\n',\n",

If this were\\nso, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide\\nwould be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in\\ncities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show\\na higher fatality rate.  But the Nat\\'l Commission on the Causes and\\nPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this\\nnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife\\nattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks\\n(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),\\nthe proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the\\nproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.\\n\\nWhat was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on\\nthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended\\nto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave\\nphysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the\\nhead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this\\npattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of\\nrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.\\n\\n\\tSource: Report on Firearms and Violence\\n\\n: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  \\n: must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  \\n: be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs,  \\n: so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the  \\n: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.\\n\\nThere are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I\\'m not\\nfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and\\nAmericans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic\\ndifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found\\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I\\ndon\\'t think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\\n\\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,\\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\\n\\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After\\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\\nweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\\n\\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\\nto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\\nregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a\\nrestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in\\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns\\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\\n\\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for\\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers\\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\\n1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same\\nstandard: the FBI\\'s Unified Crime Report.\\n\\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\\n(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\\nVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /\\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\\n(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\\n\\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\\n\\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns\\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns\\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\\nin Vancouver.\\n\\nThe authors of the report also investigated \"legally justifiable\"\\nhomicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only\\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After\\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\\nearlier findings.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the\\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\\n\\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\\ngun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.\\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study\\ninterval, Vancouver\\'s rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\\n\\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did\\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\\nduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,\\nSeattle apparently didn\\'t enjoy relief from any crime category\\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\\nself-defense.\\n\\n\\tHeavily quoted source: Handgun Regulation, Crime,\\n\\tAssaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities.\\n\\n\\tJohn H.

Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\\n\\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\\n\\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\\n\\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\\nsense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the\\ncross, would want to share in his death.\\n\\nBrian Finnerty\\n\",\n",

It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read\\n   in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:\\n \\n      For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten\\n      Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but\\n      have everlasting life.                               John 3:16\\n \\n   However, God\\'s love is qualified.  The Bible says:\\n \\n      The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he\\n      loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9\\n \\n      For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of\\n      the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6\\n \\n \\nQ. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good\\n   I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How\\n   can these verses apply to me?\\n \\nA. By  God\\'s  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is\\n   looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The\\n   Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.\\n   On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before\\n   God.\\n \\n      As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There\\n      is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after\\n      God.                                            Romans 3:10-11\\n \\n      The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately\\n      wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9\\n \\n \\nQ. If I am such a wicked person in God\\'s sight, what will God do to me?\\n \\nA. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will\\n   come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.\\n \\n      For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the\\n      lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,\\n      and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap\\n      mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They\\n      shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,\\n      and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of\\n      beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.\\n                                                Deuteronomy 32:22-24\\n \\n \\nQ. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not\\n   that bad.\\n \\nA. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-\\n   ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible\\n   makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal\\n   and consists of perpetual suffering.\\n \\n      And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was\\n      cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15\\n \\n      So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come\\n      forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall\\n      cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and\\n      gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50\\n \\n      ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with\\n      his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them\\n      that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord\\n      Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting\\n      destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory\\n      of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9\\n \\n \\nQ. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?\\n \\nA. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be\\n   accountable to God for his actions.  God\\'s perfect  justice  demands\\n   payment for sin.\\n \\n      For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23\\n \\n      For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;\\n      that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,\\n      according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.\\n                                                  2 Corinthians 5:10\\n \\n      But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,\\n      they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\\n                                                       Matthew 12:36\\n \\n \\nQ. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought\\n   to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?\\n \\nA. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our\\n   substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our\\n   sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus\\n   Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.\\n \\n      All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one\\n      to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of\\n      us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6\\n \\n      But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for\\n      our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;\\n      and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5\\n \\n      For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also\\n      received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the\\n      scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the\\n      third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4\\n \\n      For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that\\n      we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\\n                                                  2 Corinthians 5:21\\n \\n \\nQ. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was\\n   already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about\\n   Hell anymore?\\n \\nA. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it\\n   is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.\\n   Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.\\n \\n      He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he\\n      that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath\\n      of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36\\n \\n \\nQ. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that\\n   the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to\\n   Hell?\\n \\nA. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our\\n   minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole\\n   lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to\\n   the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins\\n   and serve Christ as our Lord.\\n \\n      No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,\\n      and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and\\n      despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\\n                                                        Matthew 6:24\\n \\n      Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be\\n      blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the\\n      presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19\\n \\n \\nQ. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except\\n   through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their\\n   followers also go to Hell?\\n \\nA. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-\\n   able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other\\n   religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their\\n   followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and\\n   save us.\\n \\n      Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none\\n      other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be\\n      saved.                                               Acts 4:12\\n \\n   Jesus said:\\n \\n      I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the\\n      Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6\\n \\n      If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us\\n      our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\\n                                                          1 John 1:9\\n \\n \\nQ. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?\\n \\nA. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You\\n   must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see\\n   your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.\\n \\n      And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much\\n      as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,\\n      God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13\\n \\n      ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe\\n      on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...\\n                                                       Acts 16:30-31\\n \\n \\nQ. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?\\n \\nA. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He\\n   also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that\\n   He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.\\n \\n      For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of\\n      yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8\\n \\n   God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,\\n   if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you\\n   should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is\\n   the only Word of God.\\n   In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented\\n   paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.\\n \\n      So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of\\n      God.                                              Romans 10:17\\n \\n \\nQ. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?\\n \\nA. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging\\n   our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.\\n \\n      The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a\\n      contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17\\n \\n   Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin\\n   to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we\\n   sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins\\n   as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to\\n   Hell.\\n \\n      Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him\\n      to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his\\n      iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26\\n \\n \\nQ. Doesn\\'t  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be\\n   baptized?  Will these save me?\\n \\nA. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.\\n   No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God\\'s\\n   sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-\\n   ure.  Salvation is\\n \\n      Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9\\n \\n \\nQ. What else will happen at the end of the world?\\n \\nA. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed\\n   into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-\\n   more.\\n \\n      For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,\\n      with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:\\n      and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are\\n      alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the\\n      clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be\\n      with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17\\n \\n \\nQ. What will happen to the earth at that time?\\n \\nA. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens\\n   and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-\\n   more.\\n \\n      But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in\\n      the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and\\n      the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and\\n      the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...\\n      Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new\\n      heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.\\n                                                     2 Peter 3:10,13\\n \\n \\nQ. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will\\n   come?\\n \\nA. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to\\n   save.\\n \\n      And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the\\n      world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end\\n      come.                                            Matthew 24:14\\n \\n \\nQ. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?\\n \\nA. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing\\n   of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the\\n   Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not\\n   come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the\\n   Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be\\n   very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.\\n \\n      For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden\\n      destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with\\n      child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3\\n \\n      Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his\\n      secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7\\n \\n \\nQ. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.\\n \\nA. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to\\n   destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.\\n \\n      And Jonah began to enter into the city a day\\'s journey, and he\\n      cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be\\n      overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4\\n \\n \\nQ. What did the people of Nineveh do?\\n \\nA. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented\\n   of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.\\n \\n      But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry\\n      mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil\\n      way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can\\n      tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his\\n      fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9\\n \\n \\nQ. Did God hear their prayers?\\n \\nA. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.\\n \\n \\nQ. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-\\n   ment?\\n \\nA. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has\\n   become very short.\\n \\n      How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which\\n      at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed\\n      unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3\\n \\n      In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,\\n      and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye\\n      people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for\\n      us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n            A R E  Y O U  R E A D Y  T O  M E E T  G O D ?\\n \\n \\n \\nA  book  entitled  1994?,  written by Harold Camping, presents Biblical\\ninformation that we may be very near the end of time.

A  number  of  minor\\nchanges  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing\\nand  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph\\nwhich  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the\\ntext.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they\\nappear here as indented paragraphs.\\n \\n \\nI have read Mr. Camping\\'s book, compared it with what the Bible actual-\\nly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what\\nthe  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that\\nthere  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed\\none  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these\\nmatters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return,\\nit  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our\\neternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more\\nsenseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with\\nrespect  to life expectancy no longer applies.

Newcomb)\\nSubject: Re: Some more about gun control...\\nNntp-Posting-Host: whale.st.usm.edu\\nOrganization: University of Southern Mississippi\\nLines: 145\\n\\nFirst, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and\\nerudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic.\\nFrankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of\\nthe original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the\\nwritings of the era. This  is most refreshing.\\n\\nSecond, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.\\nMy brigade\\'s quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend\\nto several matters pertaining to the State Militia.\\n\\nSome people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-\\nnism that is out of place in the 20th century. I\\'m not sure the Swiss\\nwould agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both\\norganized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,\\nMississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar\\nto one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\\nhas a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks\\nof both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary\\nbut are probably similar.\\n\\nTitle 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as \"all able-bodied\\ncitizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-\\ntwo (62) years...\". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National\\nGuard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The\\nNational Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.\\nIt tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion\\nof this \"para-constitutional\" arrangement is quite interesting in itself\\nbut somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this\\ndate, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing\\nas anything but a Federal reserve force.\\n\\nMississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized\\nMilitia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other \\nStates it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as\\na cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and\\nsenior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill\\non a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once\\na quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our\\nState-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an\\norganization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will\\ncome from the unorganized Militia.\\n\\nIn time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order\\nthe activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will\\nfirst be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either\\nits contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the\\nevent that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law\\nprovides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the\\nunorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by\\nlaw, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia\\nof Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State\\ndoes not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such\\na force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use\\nof mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. \\n\\nIt is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being\\nthe long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.\\n\\n>No, I simple stated that the people have a right to \"join a well\\n>organized militia.\"  And I have also stated that a militia that\\n>meets once or twice a year is clearly \"well organized.\"  And this\\n>state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a \"right\"\\n>to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated\\n>by Hamilton. \\n\\nRegarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton\\'s opinion as being the sole\\nrepresentative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have\\nchosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist\\nend of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can\\nbe chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that\\nthe idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia\\nor \"train bands\" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-\\nment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to\\nprovide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,\\nand iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,\\n\"terrible and irresistible\".\\n\\nThese protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation\\nof Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress\\nInsurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear\\nArms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.\\nThese limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-\\nment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.\\n\\nThe National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the \\nConstitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting\\nwars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The\\nConstitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by\\nthe Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the\\nWar of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States\\nterritory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional\\nauthorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal\\nMilitary and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until\\nWW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.\\nWhen the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new\\nmember also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were\\n\"grandfathered\". At least one of these \"grandfathered\" individuals\\nrefused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the\\nFederal Courts.\\n\\nMr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to\\nmembers of a \"well organized\" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional\\nhistory of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when\\nThe Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton\\'s\\ndefinition of \"well organized\". In the period of peace between the\\nFrench & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped\\ndrilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.\\nPerhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors\\nwho answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because\\ntheir units didn\\'t drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not\\nbe so bold.\\n\\nAgain, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is\\nnot the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton\\nnor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government\\nand many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing\\nof their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their\\nresponsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the\\nConstitution.\\n \\nMisunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one\\nerror that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The\\nConstitution prohibits States from keeping \"Troops or Ships of War\\nin time of Peace\". I have heard some insist this prevents States from\\nmaintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not\\nunderstand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.\\nToday we call any large vessel a \"ship\" but in the 18th century the word\\ndescribed a particular kind of vessel.  A \"ship\" is a large vessel with\\nthree or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A \"brig\" has two\\nmasts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping\\nthe largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today\\'s\\nequivalent might be a prohibition on the States\\' keeping nuclear missiles.\\n\"Troops\" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.\\nAny study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. \\n\\nIn at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being\\npersonally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia\\nas a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently\\nboth bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on\\ntheir place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or\\nscarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State\\'s Militia.\\n-- \\nDonald R.

Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won\\'t get into the\\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT\\'s made this\\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\\ntherapy below).\\n\\n\\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\\nconsidered \\'systemic\\' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\\ninfection.\\n\\n\\n>Steve got real upset with Elaine\\'s doctor because he was using anti-fungals \\n>and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \\n>vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \\n>Elaine\\'s doctor a quack.\\n\\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he\\'s one of those \\'evil\\' orthomolecular\\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\\n\\nHopefully, Elaine\\'s doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\\nall supplements.  I\\'m even reevaluating some supplements I\\'m taking, for\\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\\n\\n\\n>survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \\n>the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \\n\\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\\ndemonstrate candida \"blooms\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\\nnormal).\\n\\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can\\'t\\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950\\'s\\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\\ninflammation symptoms.  I\\'ll have to dig out that reference again since it\\nis relevant to this discussion.\\n\\n\\n>some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \\n>membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \\n>the candida or not isn\\'t certain.\\n\\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \\nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\\nirritation due to the body\\'s allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \\nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\\n\\nBTW, and I\\'ll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \"Sinus Survival\",\\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\\ndoesn\\'t cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He\\'s also found that\\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\\n\\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\\nlots of \\'ifs\\', and \\'implies\\', which doesn\\'t please the hard-core NT who\\nhas to have the double-blind study or it\\'s a non-issue, but one has to start\\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\\n\\n\\n>If it\\'s internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \\n>nondescript.  \\n\\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\\nand reject any and all aspects of the \\'yeast hypothesis\\' until the\\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can\\'t observe or culture\\nthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then there\\'s no way to diagnose or\\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\\n\\nIt\\'s a real Catch-22.\\n\\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the \\'yeast hypothesis\\' say that\\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it\\'s not\\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I\\'m very aware of this for the\\nsmaller funded projects).  I\\'m afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice\\'s case histories and anecdotes\\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\\n\\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it\\'s a done issue - \\nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\\n\\n\\n>Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \\n>the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \\n>vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \\n>ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \\n>they broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \\n>response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \\n>from their diets.  About 30% of all American\\'s die with less Vitamin A than \\n>they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \\n>A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \\n>barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \\n>inflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \\n\\nAren\\'t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\\n\\n\\n>While diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \\n>this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \\n>knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \\n>competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \\n>available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \\n>use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \\n>the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \\n>inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \\n>antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \\n>just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \\n>vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\\n\\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\\nspecies can grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\\nyou can\\'t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I\\'ve been in\\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\\nterm treatment of GI tract \"candidiasis\".  It\\'s like trying to weed a garden\\nby cutting off what\\'s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\\nout again once you walk away.\\n\\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida \"bloom\" can partially\\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in the\\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\\nis potentially lethal.\\n\\n\\n>In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \\n>reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \\n>favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \\n>humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \\n>minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \\n\\nAlso, if one is an \\'anal retentive\\', like I\\'ve been diagnosed in a prior\\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\\n\\n\\n>If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \\n>blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \\n>bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \\n>occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \\n>for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \\n>place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \\n>but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \\n>has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \\n>specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \\n>false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \\n>basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it\\'s nice to know that I don\\'t have \\n>colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \\n>doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\\n\\nAs I\\'ve said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don\\'t work.\\nFor example, I went to three ENT\\'s, who all said that I will just have to live\\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab\\'s failed (they did mention\\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren\\'t plugged and it would not\\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\\nexperience of the three ENT\\'s I saw who said that I\\'d just have to \"live with\\nit\".  I\\'m confident I will reach what one could call a total \"cure\".  The\\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\\nbecause of my overuse of ab\\'s for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\\n\\n\\n>...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \\n>GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \\n>patients is a non-existent syndrome.\\n\\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\\nvisits to several ENT\\'s totally floored him when they said \"you\\'ll just have\\nto live with it\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\\npractice.  I\\'m sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\\n\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\\n\"it\\'s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\", to put it mildly.\\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\\n\\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetical\\nyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\\nthousand of his patients, shouldn\\'t you at least sit up and take notice?\\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\\ninstead of why it shouldn\\'t work.  I\\'m afraid a lot of doctors have become\\nso enamored with \"scientific correctness\" that they are ignoring the patients\\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\\nwe don\\'t see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\\nwent to a couple of doctor\\'s who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\\n\\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I\\'d like to hear a doctor tell me:\\n\"well, I\\'ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\\ncountry, and since they clearly don\\'t work for you, I now have the authority\\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\\ncan\\'t promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\\nthese unproven therapies, and I\\'ll have to register your case at the State\\nBoard.\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would\\'ve jumped on this\\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it\\'s doing everything\\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\\n(true quackery).\\n\\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\\n\\n\\n>If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.

Since we, as American\\'s, have the \\ngurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the\\n2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public\\'s opinion or risk \\nvoted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with\\ndomocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.\\n  Our government as it stands, must appease the public.

I am as concerned about the media\\'s complicity in this\\ngrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the\\ninvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from\\nany other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been\\nbehind it.  What\\'s going on here?\\n\\nLet\\'s look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.\\nI\\'m a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops\\nbecause I\\'ve found some of the techniques to be useful in business\\nnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR\\nknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a\\npsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had\\nprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh\\'s behavior was\\nemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from\\ncivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their\\nisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh\\'s religious\\norientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as\\nthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being\\nconsumed in the apocalypse.\\n\\nIMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated\\npsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of\\naction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly\\nappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the\\ntanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.\\nThey KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,\\nobstensibly to perform \"gas insertions\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push\\nhim over the edge.\\n\\nLook at some supporting evidence.  Koresh\\'s attorney mentioned on TV\\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh\\'s major concern was the biblical\\nrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\\non Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)\\nclaimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true\\nthey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\\nwere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and\\nreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at\\nthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and\\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the\\n\"gas insertion\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image\\nthat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back\\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\\n\\nLet\\'s step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without\\nbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency\\ninterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation\\nof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\\n\\nThe way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,\\nabandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\\narmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited\\nhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A\\nsimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell\\nhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could not\\nhave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the\\ncompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the\\nFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the\\nrevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.

The revolver times\\nwere pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or\\nthe person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.\\n\\n\\tYou don\\'t often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger\\nwhich can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing\\ncity,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..\\n\\n\\tOf course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but\\nsuch training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I\\nknow if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off\\nchance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn\\'t guarantee that\\n\\'Mr. Bad\\' won\\'t figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time\\nto draw a second gun and shoot \\'Mr. Bad\\' before it\\'s too late.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks\\nin my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact,\\nit was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate \\'safety\\' is YOU the\\noperator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I\\ndon\\'t say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.\\n\\n\\tAs per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree\\n100%.

She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like\\nthis before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the\\nfamily.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision\\nwas made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.\\n\\nWell, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had\\na bowl of another Kellog\\'s frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am\\nembarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once\\nin a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think \"Oh, oh, this is the\\nsame kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.\"  Ten \\nminutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure\\nto a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.\\n\\nWhen I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for\\nthe seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now\\nafter this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even\\nhe is scratching his head.

I know\\n>that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet\\n>hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying\\' You fools,\\n>do you still think that just believing is enough?\\'\\n\\nActually I don\\'t think there is any conflict if we really understand\\nwhat these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the \\nmeaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will\\ncome to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere \\nbelief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your \\nbelief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this \\nis what James means when he says that \"faith without works is dead\" \\nand, \"I will show you my faith by my works.\"  Remember James was \\nwriting to \"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.\"  This \\nprobably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much \\nlater and wouldn\\'t understand the meaning of the original Greek.\\n(Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he\\nintended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the\\npeople of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of\\nthe Greek.\\n\\nAnother key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul\\'s\\nstatements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul\\ncontrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the\\ngospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great\\nburden of Paul\\'s life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go\\nconvert a bunch of people, then the \"Judizers\" would come along and\\ntry to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf\\nActs chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being\\nsaved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood\\nof Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation\\nfor today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think\\n\"faithfulness\" today has a meaning closer to what the original\\nwriters intended.\\n\\n>Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves\\n>and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.\\n\\nI think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is\\nthat God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not \"keep kosher\" to a\\nkosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters\\nof following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.\\n\\n>But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to\\n>him (i.e. doesn\\'t know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who\\n>knows and believes in God but doesn\\'t make any attempt to live by the bible.\\n\\nIn the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and \\nbe lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are \\nworse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in\\nthe parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in\\nthe one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that\\nthe price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.\\n\\n[I agree with you in general, including the fact that \"pistis\" has\\nsome of the force of \"faithful\".  However if you take that too far,\\nyou can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have\\nintended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say\\nthat we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we\\nare saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that\\'s not what you meant.\\n\\nI have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that\\ncompletely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I\\'d\\ncall a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and\\ncommitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic\\nchange.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show\\nthe new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any\\nChristian there had better be the basic change in orientation that\\nJesus calls being born again.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\\n>  program.\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

       " \"From: brownli@ohsu.edu@ohsu.edu (Liane Brown)\\nSubject: DOCTRINE OF GOD\\nOrganization: Oregon Health Sciences University\\nLines: 111\\n\\nThis is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this \\ndoctrine:\\n\\n\\n                        THE DOCTRINE OF GOD\\n\\n\\nI.   THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD\\n     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most\\n     important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God. \\n     Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should\\n     be to know God.\\n     I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three\\n     Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the\\n     Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I\\n     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in\\n     nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each\\n     possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also\\n     equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.\\n     Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.\\n\\nII.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.\\n     A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for\\n         Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and\\n         unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without\\n         ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.\\n     B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.\\n     C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.\\n         As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,\\n         patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;\\n         Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.\\n     D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely\\n         without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of\\n         sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.\\n         6:3.\\n     E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time\\n         in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all\\n         knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,\\n         infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with\\n         unlimited power over all creation).\\n         God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It\\n         is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day\\n         has become very man-centered, and that the people in our\\n         churches know very little about God.  I believe that the\\n         Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the\\n         people of God need to understand that God is sovereign\\n         in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives\\n         of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes\\n         regarding salvation.\\n\\nIII.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.\\n     A.  In creation\\n          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in\\n          creating, and all Three are active in sustaining\\n          creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs\\n          (for nations as well as individual people) to the end\\n          of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;\\n          Heb. 1:3.\\n     B.  In salvation\\n         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is\\n         absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man. \\n         All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,\\n         active in salvation.\\n         1.  God, the Father\\n             Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the\\n             Godhead determined in eternity past that there would\\n             be salvation, the conditions under which people\\n             could and would be saved, and even who would be\\n             saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in\\n             Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph\\n             1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.\\n         2.  Christ, the Son of God\\n             The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the\\n             virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two\\n             important works:\\n             a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of\\n                  God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.\\n             b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the\\n                  Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on\\n                  the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by\\n                  His present intercessory work in heaven.  The\\n                  work of salvation will be completed for us when\\n                  the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-\\n                  4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.\\n         3.  The Holy Spirit\\n             As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is\\n             Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is\\n             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the\\n             following ways:\\n             a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11\\n             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new\\n                  birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.\\n             c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work\\n                  of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.\\n             d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making \\n                  salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.\\n             e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of\\n                  Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13\\n             f.   He teaches every believer the truth of\\n                  Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.\\n             g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of \\n                  God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12\\n             h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.\\n             i.   He empowers for living and for service.  \\n                  Cf. Acts 1:8\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------\\nLiane Brown\\n(Internet) brownli@ohsu.edu\\nPortland Oregon\\n\",\n",

I understand getting one is far more difficult\\nthere than here.  In the U.S. it\\'s a joke. \\n\\n       But my usual objection is that you\\'re discussing two different\\nthings.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver\\'s license is a permit\\nto operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary\\nto own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the\\nability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise\\nfrom the government\\'s legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations\\nfor behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance,\\nwhich is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get\\npast legally, since it wouldn\\'t be based on making regulations on public\\nproperty, but in restricting activity on private property.              \\n\\n>Use of guns in crimes (in Norway):\\n>Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners \\'arms\\'\\n>for a long time, but these are rather the exeption.\\n>Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short \\n>time befor the crime.\\n>\\n>Use of knives:\\n>It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or \\'open\\'.\\n>You (Americans) think it\\'s ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open\\n>in public -rigth ??\\n\\n        This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have\\na difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions,\\nwhere the laws from one state to another can be as radically different\\nas from one country in Europe to another).\\n\\n        Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow\\nconcealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can\\nbe either a state or local restriciton.       \\n\\n>Individual vs masses:\\n>Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some\\n>extent....\\n>Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ??\\n>What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of \\n>all the others ??\\n\\n       The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual\\naffecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually\\nget is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within\\nthis group, here defined as \"people who own guns,\") are adversely affecting \\nthe rights of some other group.  \\n\\n       If for instance, \"Bob\" were using his gun to attack \"Steve,\" you\\'d\\nhave a point.  But essentially what we\\'re discussing is that becuase\\nsome person who qualifies as a member of the group \"people who own\\nguns\" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told\\nthat their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else\\'s\\nrights.  It\\'s like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited\\nby one.\\n\\n>The issue:\\n>I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.\\n\\n       The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to\\nwhat extent guns and gun legislation impact those.\\n\\n>We shouldn\\'t mix weapons and items that can serve as one....\\n>IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.\\n>But should it have to be like that ??\\n\\n       Of course not.

Nor do I expect we will.\\n\\n>Do you think it\\'s wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??\\n\\n       No state does.  In any case, there\\'s a limit to which the state\\nmay enforce it\\'s \"wisdom\" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise\\nconcept.

I\\'ve been reflecting on what certain words meant in my \\nchildhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. \\n\\nI grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very \\nangry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It \\ncarried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some \\ntime to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ\\' and \\n`Christian\\'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To \\nbecome a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would \\nconsider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared \\nto pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a \\nbetter bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable \\nriches of knowing Christ.\\n\\nAs it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that \\nthey were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time \\nthey had decided it wasn\\'t a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They \\ndidn\\'t disown me but they didn\\'t completely accept the situation either.  \\nFor example, they didn\\'t come to my wedding because it was in a church.   \\nWhen I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her \\ndeath, she said to me, \"As far as I\\'m concerned, you still are a Jew.\" \\nWhat she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a \\nJew.  I am a Christian.  (I\\'ll concede, one that likes chicken soup with \\nmatzoh balls.:-)) \\n\\nI do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My \\nsons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who \\ndo consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people \\nJews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.\\n\\nThis is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their \\nexperience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while \\nfollowing Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  \\n\\nI am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  \\nIt was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have \\na sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small \\nsacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it \\nand do not want to ask for it back.\\n\\nAnd while I don\\'t have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  \\nI am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the \\nChurch.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is \\nthat it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, \\nbeing rooted in the past. \\n\\nThis is probably one of the reasons why I don\\'t like it when people mess \\naround with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of \\nEaster).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.\\n\\nI suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn\\'t assume that all \\nbelievers of Jewish background are the same.

[...]\\n\\n\\tHmmm.  There are other animals on this planet with advanced\\n\\tmental facilities which have not developed \"religion\" as a\\n\\tsatisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?\\n\\n\\tFurther, it appears that only humans have a \"need\" to explain the\\n\\tunexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,\\n\\tincluding those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly\\n\\tcontent in their ignorance.\\n\\n\\tI\\'d like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me\\n\\tfrom your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal\\n\\t*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need\\n\\tnot be researched; 3) religion was \"made up\" by humans to address a\\n\\tperceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that\\n\\tis, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical\\n\\tstructure with biology at the apex).\\n\\n\\tNeedless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the\\n\\tunderlying presuppositions.\\n\\n>Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are \\n>because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life\\n>a safety blanked to hide behind.  \"Oh wow..all i have to do is \\n>follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness.\"\\n>For all of you \"found jeezus\" , how many of you were \"on the brink?\"\\n\\n\\tI disagree that Christianity is \"an infectious cult\".  It has\\n\\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\\n\\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\\n\\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\\n\\t\"infectious\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\\n\\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\\n\\tis the case).\\n\\n\\tI disagree that Christianity is \"a safety blanket\" which supplants\\n\\thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\\n\\tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\\n\\tChristian\\'s source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\\n\\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\\n\\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\\n\\tcontrol over one\\'s own life the problem or is it something else?\\n\\n\\tFinally, one does not appropriate \"eternal happiness\" by following\\n\\tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\\n\\tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\\n\\tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\\n\\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\\n\\tin the Person of God\\'s Spirit.\\n\\n\\tHeaven is one of two final states that\\n\\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\\n\\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\\n\\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\\n\\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\\n\\n>but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its\\n>infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian\\n>group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which\\n>basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.\\n\\n\\tMany Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\\n\\tpriority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\\n\\tas a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\\n\\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\\n\\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\\n\\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\\n\\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\\n\\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\\n\\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\\n\\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\\n\\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\\n\\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\\n\\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\\n\\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\\n\\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\\n\\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\\n\\tconversion).\\n\\n\\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\\n\\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\\n\\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\\n\\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\\n\\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\\n\\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\\n\\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\\n\\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\\n\\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\\n\\n>We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we\\n>die.      \\n\\n\\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\\n\\tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\\n\\tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\\n\\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\\n\\ta more expansive view.\\n\\n\\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\\n\\tarts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language\\n\\tof other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?\\n\\tHow is it that humans can organize themselves in various social\\n\\tstructures whereas other animals have only one structure?)\\n\\n>Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG.\\n\\n\\tBlatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.\\n\\tChristianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not\\n\\ta *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship\\n\\twith a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-\\n\\tknit relationship with this appelation.\\n\\n>Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject\\n>themselves with jeezus and live with that high. \\n\\n\\tThere are \"Jesus freaks\" who let the emotional aspects of worship\\n\\tand Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,\\n\\tthis does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these\\n\\tthings flow.\\n\\n>It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious\\n>wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.\\n\\n\\tGuilty by association?  That \"christianity\" which forces itself\\n\\tupon another is not Christianity at all.\\n\\n>When Christians see a \"non-believer\", they say that person is blind\\n>to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live\\n>with this mask of fakeness each day.

There\\nis a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts\\nwithout active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really\\nbeautiful way to hear the Passion is it\\'s being chanted by three\\ndeacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants\\nin the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.\\nThis is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion\\nthat John would prefer.\\n\\nBut there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations.\\nEach pastor makes his own decisions (it isn\\'t a church-wide conspiracy\\nagainst participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial\\nblessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already\\ngetting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they\\nshould not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the\\norchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation\\nin the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation\\n--- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be\\nnecessary to go with the briefer options just to \"get \\'em in and get \\'em\\nout\".\\n\\nEach parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to\\ntheir geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish\\nin the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy\\ncloser to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow\\nparishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors\\ngenerally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though\\nyou probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly\\nto the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn\\'t follow\\nthe continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no\\nsingle one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated\\nequilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them,\\nthen the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering\\nthe names of the evolutionary theories.}\\n-- \\n                                                    --- Tim Rolfe\\n                                                 rolfe@dsuvax.dsu.edu\\n                                                 rolfe@junior.dsu.edu\\n                                                RolfeT@columbia.dsu.edu\\n',\n",

       " 'From: kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu (Dr Nancy\\'s Sweetie)\\nSubject: Re: Certainty and Arrogance\\nOrganization: Rowan College of New Jersey\\nLines: 122\\n\\nIn an earlier article, I explained that what many people find arrogant about\\nChristians is that some Christians profess absolute certianty about their\\nbeliefs and doctrines.  That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have\\nmade any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying\\nthat they are infallible.\\n\\nImpicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will\\nprobably agree.\\n\\nIn short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any\\npart of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning,\\nthen those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved,\\nthere is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing \"There\\nis no way out of the loop.\"\\n\\n\\nSomeone called `REXLEX\\' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but\\nhe did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase\\nSartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument\\nleads to relativism.\\n\\nAs I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false\\nbecause you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because\\nyou dislike them.  `REXLEX\\' wrote:\\n\\n>  I disagree with Dr Nancy\\'s Sweetie\\'s conclusion because if it is\\n> taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.\\n\\nHowever, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX\\' has\\nwritten does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does\\nnot like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThere were two sentences in `REXLEX\\'s post that seemed relevant to the\\npoint at hand:\\n\\n>  There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be\\n> experienced and it is verifiable.\\n\\nI do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I\\nhave, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don\\'t claim to\\nbe infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I\\ndo claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.\\n\\nHowever, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about\\nthem, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier\\narticle.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted\\nin very limited circumstances.\\n\\n\\n>  It is only because of God\\'s own revelation that we can be absolute\\n> about a thing.\\n\\nBut how far does that get you?  Once God\\'s revelation stops, and your own\\nreasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s suppose that our modern Bible translations include a\\nperfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said,\\nexactly, \"This is my body.\"\\n\\nWe\\'ll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely\\ntrue.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.\\n\\nAt the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the\\npossibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do\\nnot have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of\\nTran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn\\'t say.

(This\\nis something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)\\n\\nWhy should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be\\nfallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?\\n\\nSo, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is\\nthat Jesus said \"This is my body.\"  Beyond that, once we start making up\\ndoctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we\\nget into trouble.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain\\nof.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they\\ncannot be certain.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know\\nthat human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not\\nbelieve we are infallible, any more than we do.\\n\\nWhen Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead\\nthem astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non-\\nChristians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is\\nhardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you\\nare either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\\nto cover them up.\\n\\nI think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what\\nthings we are only \"very confident\" of.  For example, we might say that we\\nknow our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But\\nother things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical\\nthinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are\\nvery confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.\\n\\nBut, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting\\nas if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.\\n\\n *\\n\\n`REXLEX\\' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by\\nFrancis Schaeffer.

On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed\\na transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they\\nwere generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation\\nbetween the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness\\nfrom reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan\\'s\\nmodel showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model \\nin sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to\\nour boy\\'s model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in\\nthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer.\\nHe predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry,\\nthe biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would\\nprobably see even less cooling.

Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with\\nhis wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined\\nslights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this\\'ll\\nhappen by the end of a single restaurant meal).

But it\\'s hard.\\n   From time to time I\\'ve wanted to drop the pretense that we have a\\nrelationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful\\nrelationship, by talking honestly with him, but I\\'ve always thought, \"Why\\nbe dramatic?

Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to\\ncome back.\" It\\'s been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on\\nwith the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I\\ncould think of.\\n   Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn\\'t going\\nto pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the\\noutcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and\\nraved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and\\nin which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was\\nbeyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the\\nallowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not\\nquietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their\\nrelationship, she didn\\'t want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung\\nup. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is\\nthe first time she\\'s ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if\\nshe\\'s divorced my brother, and that it\\'s a relief in some ways to have the\\nbreak out in the open and done with.\\n \\n    I have mixed feelings. I\\'m proud of Mom for sticking up for herself;\\nangry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for\\npersisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their\\nchildren; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my\\nbrother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us\\nthat he\\'s willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to\\nappease an unappeasable,\\nemotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess;\\nscared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will\\nchange and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self-\\nrighteous over this bit of proof that they can\\'t \"get away\" with treating\\nus or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even\\nbeginning to gloat over others\\' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad,\\nsad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in\\na horrible, destructive situation that they can\\'t see a way out of--or\\nthey can\\'t bear to take whatever paths they do see.

The person in Hell would not be suffering. \\nGranted, they wouldn\\'t be *anything* (wouldn\\'t be having any\\nconscious experience whatsoever). \\n\\n    You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning \\nto a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort \\nof eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to\\nbe conscious throughout this eternity. \\n\\n    Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the\\nproduct of propaganda (\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\"\\nIt\\'s my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife.\\nCan anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all\\nanimals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the\\nidea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of\\nsuper-survival. \\n\\n \\n>and it\\'s a lot worse than Heaven.

Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to\\nextremes before stopping at \"moderation.\"  I think we have seen the extreme of\\nthe \"hell fire & brimstone\" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme\\nwhere hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones\\nsensibilities.\\n\\nI forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a\\nstory.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the\\npoint of telling him that he didn\\'t believe in Satan or hell.  He believed\\neverybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to\\npray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man\\nwouldn\\'t do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don\\'t believe in\\nhell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn\\'t\\nexist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn\\'t\\nexist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And\\nyet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.\\n\\nI\\'d use a different illustration however.

As the\\nsurgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which\\nis still of the old creation.

It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \\nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM DESIGN\\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \\ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\\n\\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\\nrelatively short time.\\n\\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \\nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \\nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \\nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\\n\\n\\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \\nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\\nand participate in the management of technology.

Neil Smith\\n\\n                   LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE\\n\\n[AUTHOR\\'S NOTE:  \"Adrian\" -- name changed to protect the guilty -- \\nand the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with \\nthe same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]\\n\\nDear Adrian:  \\n\\nI\\'m way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to \\nyour note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and \\ngenerally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist \\nmostly of assertions you\\'re free to believe (or not) I can back \\nwith evidence and logic I\\'ve neither time nor energy to present \\nnow.  I\\'ve written fully on this topic before and will again in the \\nfuture.  When I do, I\\'ll make sure you get copies.  \\n\\nThere are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger \\nof delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. \\n10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, \\nshifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic \\nrifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I\\'ll \\nlimit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent \\nwith your note.  \\n\\nFirst, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nSecond, publication of some latter-day \"scientific study\" doesn\\'t \\nalter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my \\ninterview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  \\n\\nThird, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nFourth, as often happens with these things, the \"study\" doesn\\'t \\nsupport the gun prohibitionists\\' original numerical contentions \\nanyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older \\nbody of lies, omissions, and distortions.  \\n\\nFifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nSixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on \\ncountless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND \\nBEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this \\npresent \"study\" dubious, to say the least.  \\n\\nSeventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \\na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \\nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \\nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nEighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat \\n(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you \\nshould be better aware than most people how \"progress\" -- in \\ndesigning \"studies\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our \\nability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree \\non is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 \\nyears to create \"studies\" \"proving\" that pornography causes crime.  \\nMore naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s \\nclearly indicate the contrary.  \\n\\nNinth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nTenth, another reason to doubt all such \"studies\" is that human \\nbehavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far\\ntoo complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The \\nattempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the \\nresulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  \\n\\nEleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \\na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \\nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \\nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nTwelfth, the \"study\" is also worthless because it incorporates \\nfigures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but \\nbasically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social \\nbenefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a \\ncriminal offense.  \\n\\nThirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials \\nquoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are \\nmany), are correct in this instance:  the \"study\" is meaningless \\nbecause the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nAnd because of that, Adrian, even if the \"study\" were valid, it \\nwouldn\\'t deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that \\nanyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, \\nwhenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody\\'s \\npermission. In this I\\'m ably assisted by gun prohibitionists \\nthemselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed \\npeople to go out and buy their first gun \"while they still can\".  \\nBefore the \\'68 Gun Control Act, most of the \"shooting fraternity\" \\nviewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, \\nineffective toys.  There probably weren\\'t six million of them in \\nthe whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, \\nand their ilk -- AMERICA\\'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we \\nprobably manufacture at least that many every year.\\n\\nThe fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly \\naware of this -- so I guess you\\'ll have to ask them yourself what \\ntheir real motives are.  \\n\\nLook:  gun-making isn\\'t an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, \\nit\\'s easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; \\nthe fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the \\nself-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing \\nthis further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a \\nquarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \"half life\" \\nof 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna \\nbe around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.\\n\\nAs for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law \\nprovides or any court decides, I\\'m always going to be armed.  And I \\nwill always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is \\nthat there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands \\n-- where I come from.  We can\\'t be stopped by passing laws, we can \\nonly be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given \\nboth the practical and alleged differences between full automatics \\nand semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  \\n\\nSo what\\'s the point?  \\n\\nL.

What\\'s up?\\n| \\n| This is a frequently asked question.  Every time it arises, it causes\\n| months of debate.  So let me see if I can answer you directly.\\n| Basically it\\'s because the Law was given to Moses as part of a\\n| specific covenanent with the Jews.  Most of us aren\\'t Jews, so we\\n| aren\\'t part of that covenant.  There was an argument early in\\n| Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to\\n| Gentiles who became Christians.  You can see the account of this\\n| debate in Acts 15.  The main question there was circumcision, but\\n| keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well.  The apostles\\n| concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians,\\n| and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us.\\n\\n1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom\\n4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only\\ndid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it\\nwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).\\n\\n2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise\\nwhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the\\npeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised\\n\"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is\\nbased on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law\\nGod promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their\\nhearts\" (Heb. 8:10).\\n\\n3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The\\nSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt\\nhad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been\\neven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly\\nSabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at\\nany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was\\n*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).\\n\\n4.  Israel stands for God\\'s people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*\\nthe Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the\\ncovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises\\nbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born\\ninto Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of\\nIsrael\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ\\'s, then are ye\\nAbraham\\'s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are\\nAbraham\\'s seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the\\ncriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the\\npromise God made to all his people the Israelites.\\n\\n| \\n| While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us,\\n| because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews,\\n| we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected\\n| from the Jews and the things he expects from us.  After all, it\\'s the\\n| same God.  However there are several ways of dealing with this.\\n| \\n| These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments\\n| into \"moral\" and \"ceremonial\".  Ceremonial commandments apply only to\\n| the Jews.  They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant.  These are\\n| thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision.  Moral laws apply to\\n| everyone.  Most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law, except\\n| for the commandment about the Sabbath.  I believe most people who take\\n| this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on\\n| the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law, but a general obligation to\\n| worship regularly is part of the general moral law.  Thus Christians\\n| are free to choose the specific time we worship.\\n\\nPeople would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath\\ncommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the\\nceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even\\nif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan\\nsun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,\\nsanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders\\nagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in\\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study).\\n| \\n| A more radical approach (which is generally connected with John Calvin\\n| and the Reformed tradition) says that the Law as a whole is no longer\\n| binding.  Instead, we are entirely under grace, and our behavior\\n| should be guided solely by love.  Portions of the OT Law are still\\n| useful as guidance.  But they are not properly speaking legally\\n| binding on us.  In practice most people who take this position do not\\n| believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce.  While\\n| we may no longer be under Law, as sinners, it\\'s not safe for us to go\\n| into situations with no principles to guide us.  We\\'re too good at\\n| self-justification for that to be safe.  Thus Christians do have moral\\n| guidance, from things like Jesus\\' teachings, Paul\\'s advice, etc.\\n| These may not be precisely a Law, but they serve much the same\\n| function as, and have largely the same content as, the \"moral law\" in\\n| the previous analysis.  While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed\\n| legal responsibility to worship on any specific day, he would say that\\n| given human weakness, the discipline of regular worship is important.\\n| \\nI do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God\\nsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,\\nwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the\\nSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important\\nenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that\\nthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but\\nfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in\\ncourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me\\ngrace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I\\nam now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed\\nlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through\\nfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is\\nholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).\\n\\n| In both analyses, the specific day is not an issue.  As a matter of\\n| tradition, we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ\\'s\\n| resurrection.  There\\'s some debate about what Acts shows about early\\n| Christian worship.  The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish\\n| Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath, but\\n| that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then.\\n| Act 20:7 shows worship on the first day (Sunday), and I Cor 16:2 also\\n| implies gatherings on that day.\\n| \\n| There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to\\n| worship on the Sabbath (Saturday).  The best-known are the Seventh-Day\\n| Adventists and Jehovah\\'s Witnesses.  They argue that Act 20:7 is not a\\n| regular worship service, but a special meeting to see Paul off, and\\n| that I Cor 16:2 doesn\\'t explicitly say it\\'s a regular worship service.\\n\\nDo you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows\\nthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did\\nnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to\\nAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\"\\nwith \"go to a worship service.\"\\n| \\n| It\\'s clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul\\'s time.  See\\n| Rom 14:5.  Paul\\'s advice is that we should be very careful about\\n| judging each other on issues like this.  One person sees a specific\\n| day as mandated by God, while another does not.  He who observes that\\n| specific day does it in honor of the Lord.  He who believes his\\n| worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the\\n| Lord.  (Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue\\n| that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here.  Note however Col\\n| 2:16, which says something similar but briefer.  It explicitly\\n| mentions Sabbath.)\\n\\nWrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath\\nday of the moral law.\\n| \\n| There are some differences among Christians about use of the word\\n| \"Sabbath\".  Originally the term referred to the 7th Day, the Jewish\\n| day of worship.  Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday, the\\n| day of Christian worship.  They do this largely so that they can apply\\n| the 4th (or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering\\n| schemes) commandment to it.  Reformed tradition does not do this.  It\\n| distinguishes between the Sabbath -- which is the observance mandated\\n| for Jews, and the Lord\\'s Day -- which is the free Christian worship.\\n| (The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev 1:10.)  There\\n| are also differences about laws regarding this day.  Many Christians\\n| support \"blue laws\", both in secular law and church law, setting aside\\n| that day and causing people to spend it in worship.  The more radical\\n| anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish\\n| Sabbath, which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the\\n| Lord\\'s Day.\\n| \\nWhy would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments\\nwhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a\\nGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could\\nnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a\\nbroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law\\nbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to\\nfollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to\\nmake false gods, to violate God\\'s name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to\\nkill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight\\nwhen placed next to the word of God.\\n\\nDarius\\n\\n[It\\'s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I\\nthink Paul\\'s comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is\\nprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing\\nwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally\\naccept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing\\ntheir best to honor the Lord.\\n\\nHowever I\\'d like to be clear that I do not think there\\'s unambiguous\\nproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\\nindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\\n\\nThe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually\\nabout something else.  They both look like they are talking about\\nnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they\\ngathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of\\ninformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  \\n\\nAct 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple\\nworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the\\ntemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of\\nChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn\\'t tell us\\nwhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius\\'\\nconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no\\nreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the\\nBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to\\nme that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn\\'t say they gathered to\\nsee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,\\nPaul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that\\'s just not explicit\\nenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\\nthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul\\'s\\ncollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\\nto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can\\'t disprove it,\\nbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\\nwhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\\nit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\\nSo I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day\\nof every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \\n\\nI think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\\nis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\\nworship was.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

But if we step back from the name-calling and\\nlook at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying\\nto express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the\\nChristian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \"Word of\\nGod\", \"inerrant\", \"infallibale\", \"The Manufacturer\\'s Handbook\", \"The\\nonly rule of faith and practice in the church today\" to describe the\\nBible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at\\nthe mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably\\nfalse and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are\\ngenerally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even\\nwhen the speaker\\'s words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical\\nexample is from the garden of Eden where God asks \"Where are you?\" and Adam\\nexplains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had\\nanswered God\\'s words he would have said something like \"I\\'m here in this\\ntree.\" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these\\nwords are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif.

Dr. Noordewier has \\nappointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and \\nhas extensive experience in basic biological research in addition \\nto his current work in computational biology.\\n\\n12:00-2:45pm \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for \\n Biologists\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)\\n\\nAn overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be \\npresented, as it relates to actual and potential biological \\napplications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming \\nlanguages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as \\nselected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge \\nrepresentation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended \\naudience includes biologists with some computational background, \\nbut no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. \\nLathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has \\nworked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to \\nbiological problems in both academia and industry.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory \\n in Biological Sequence Analysis\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos \\n National Laboratory) \\n\\nThis tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of \\nintelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine \\nlearning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely \\ninterrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical \\nneural networks to elicit both specific signals and general \\ncharacteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such \\napproaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic \\nviews of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical \\nDivision at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such \\ntechniques in this domain.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\" \\n Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)\\n\\nThe genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly \\nnon-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally \\ninspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both \\nthe biological motivations, and the actual implementation and \\ncharacteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an \\nextension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size \\nand shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will \\nalso be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to \\nbiological applications, and to identifying resources and software \\nthat will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, \\na Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught \\nthis subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in \\nthe field.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\" \\n Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) \\n & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)\\n\\nApproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies \\nare increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of \\ntools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic \\npattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of \\ngenetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the \\nidentification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes \\nin sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and \\nfunctional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty \\nappointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, \\nrepresents the branch of this field that considers higher-order \\nsyntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski \\nhas studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area \\nof word-based analyses.\\n\\n                      REGISTRATION FORM\\nMail, with check made out to \"ISMB-93\", to:\\n\\n               ISMB Conference, c/o J.

Why is\\nthis?  Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as well?\\n\\nAlso, why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement of\\nonly about 5% of the corneal depth, while RK is done to a depth of up to\\n95%?  Why such a difference?  I thought the proceedures were simmilar\\nwith the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK.  I must not\\nbe understanding all of the differences.\\n\\nIn the FAQ, the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than\\nwith glasses alone.  If this is completly attributable to the\\nintentional slight undercorrection, then it can be compensated for when\\nnecessary with glasses (or contacts, if they CAN be worn afterall!).  It\\nis important to know if that is not the case, however, and some other\\nconsequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision.

The fact that the woman is holding\\nboth and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that the\\nCatholic Church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughout\\nthe world, and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the blood\\nof redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which the\\nHoly Sacrafice of the Mass, can be said and celebrated in all the\\nnations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11, \"From the rising of the\\nsun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywhere\\nthere is sacrafice, and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation,\\nfor my Name is great among the gentiles, says the Lord of hosts.\"  And\\nso we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote \"For as often as you eat this\\nbread and drink this cup, you show the Lord\\'s death until he comes.\" (1\\nCorinthians 11.26)\\n\\n\\tYou are quite right about the identification of \"Babylon the Great,\\nMother of all Harlots\" with Rome.

Biomedical research doesn\\'t make any basic \\nassumptions that aren\\'t the same as any other discipline of scientific\\nresearch.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis\\nand test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than \\n\"the old Newtonian model of the world\".  And I doubt that many psychologists\\nwould appreciate being put outside this empirical \"world view\".  Psychology\\nalso has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending. \\n\\n>It is also important to distinguish reason from science. Science may be\\n>reasonable, but so are many non-scientific methodologies. Aristotle reasoned\\n>that frogs came from mud by observing one hop out of a puddle. \\n\\nOversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa-\\ntion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually \\nfound wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will \\nhave continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.  \\nThere\\'s nothing at all surprising about this, it\\'s the way the gathering of\\nknowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own \\ndiscipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base,\\neven idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won\\'t have come\\nto these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had \\na vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and \\ntested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting\\nscience and research can\\'t seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a \\ncreative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally\\nturned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.  \\n\\nAgain, I think it gets down to defining what you mean by \"science\".  I often\\ndon\\'t recognize what it is that I do, and am involved in, in the way science\\nis portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities.  They\\nportray science as a collection of immutable facts, pronouncements of TRUTH\\nin big gold letters.  That\\'s silly.  Its as though we just go into the lab,\\nturn over a stone, and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regula-\\ntion.  Its much more interesting than that.

(assuming that\\n  the Pope\\'s position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\\n  don\\'t jointly make such  choice.)\\n\\nIf not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\\nIf I adopt the view that \"I\\'m NOT wrong, I CAN\\'T be wrong, and\\nthere\\'s NO WAY I\\'ll change my mind, YOU must change yours\", that\\nI\\'ve either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\\n\\nThe Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction\\nviewing authority as present in each bishop, and in Ecumenical\\nCouncils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines \\nregarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of\\nthe Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into\\nthe merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that\\na split occurred, and don\\'t paly what appear to be semantic games\\nlike \"He\\'s the Pope, but we don\\'t recognize that what he does\\nis effective...\".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.\\n\\n>So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\\n>Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?

Jewish history as recorded in the Old Testament and\\nas shown by archaeology are the same.  Kings, revivals, Temples, and all.\\n\\nThe Torah, as far as I know, is the five books of Moses.  Then come the\\nProphets (all the Prophets, plus Joshua, Judges, 1&2 Samuel, 1&2 Kings)\\nand the Writings (Psalms, Proverbs, Lamentations, Ruth, Esther, Ezra,\\nNehemiah, Ecclesiates, Song of Songs, 1&2 Chronicles, Job).\\n\\nAnd the veracity of Isaiah, which you quoted to your Moslem friend is\\nquite well known.  A complete manuscript exists that dates back to past\\n200 BC, and is kept in a Museum in Israel.  It was found among the Dead\\nSea Scrolls, which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the\\nOld Testament, as they date back to around the time of Christ, whereas\\nbefore, the oldest complete manuscript in Hebrew was from around 900 AD.\\n\\nYour Moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so.  If Jesus\\nwas crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been God, for only\\nthe death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity.  And as\\nIsaiah predicts, the messiah will be called \"the mighty God.\"  And if he\\nwas God, then he must have rose, for as St. Paul wrote, it was not\\npossible that death could hold him.  And if Jesus rose from the dead,\\nyour Moslem friend would have little reason to be a Moslem.  Which is\\nwhy he denies the authenticity of the Old Testament.\\n\\nAndy Byler\\n',\n",

We decided\\nthat the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith\\nwas too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a\\ndate), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.\\n\\nDuring the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church. \\n\\nWhen our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she \\nbe baptised as Catholic. This wasn\\'t a problem with me.\\n\\nDuring a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease\\nthat affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for\\ntwo months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated \"effectively\".\\n\\nIn other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.\\n\\nDuring the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over\\nmy daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday\\nvisitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study\\nbooks to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.\\n\\nLast fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings.\\nAt that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time,\\nI started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend.\\nI did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a\\nreligious community.\\n\\nToday, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for \\nCommunion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine\\n(The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then\\nballed the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the\\npew in front of us.\\n\\nI feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her\\nreligious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments\\nif you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.\\n\\nMy daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and\\nmature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly\\nfor religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with\\nmy daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.\\n\\nMy initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith\\nin Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I\\nwould never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays\\nwith her again.\\n\\nI do not want to \"drive her from the fold\", and would be willing to allow her\\nto continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only\\nfor two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.\\n\\nAny suggestions?\\n\\nIf you have a response, please e-mail me a copy.

She was a cheerful\\n    girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but\\n    one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.\\n\\n    The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on\\n    the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-\\n    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally\\n    arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and\\n    give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon\\n    on\\tthe  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love\\n    we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to\\n    die rather than commit a mortal sin.\\n\\n    Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy\\n    Eucharist.\\tHer  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father\\'s\\n    absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the\\trest  of  the\\n    day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is\\n    until\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -4-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.\\n    Thus ended the happiest day of Maria\\'s life.\\n\\n    Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling\\n    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her\\n    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,\\tMaria\\n    took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.\\n    She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the\\n    Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti\\'s, owning\\n    a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other\\n    children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she\\n    did the Holy Will of God.\\n\\n    During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)\\ttwice\\n    made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On\\n    both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro\\'s\\n    strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she\\n    even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria\\tlived\\n    in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.\\n\\n\\n    On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  \"get  a\\n    handkerchief,\"  as\\the  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath\\n    the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the\\n    baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered\\n    what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a\\n    91/2\"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told\\n    him she wouldn\\'t go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He\\n    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia\\n    instantly realized what he was up to. \"No, No, No! Do  not\\ttouch\\n    me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!\" At this point Alessandro\\n    held the knife over Maria\\'s chest, who was now on the floor.\\n\\n    \"Will you or will you not?\" Maria gathered all her energy.\\t\"No I\\n    will  not,\\tAlessandro,  no!\"   She had chosen her martyrdom over\\n    sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the\\n    knife  into   Maria\\'s  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to\\n    his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the\\n    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying\\n    of the baby Teresa\\ton  the  landing  brought  the\\tattention  to\\n    Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended\\n    and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find\\n    Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.\\n    When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   \"He\\n    wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.\"\\n\\n    The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro\\taway.\\n    As\\tthe  ambulance\\tcarried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd\\n    followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for\\n    poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First\\n    Communion\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -5-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.\\n    He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  \"Yes.  For the\\n    love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me\\n    in\\tParadise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have.\" Maria\\n    died at about three o\\'clock.\\n\\n    Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria\\'s  death  but\\n    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in\\n    prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-\\n    ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of\\n    a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to\\n    him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God\\'s par-\\n    don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony\\n    in\\tMaria\\'s  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,\\n    on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the\\n    first mother ever to be present at her daughter\\'s canonisation.\\n\\n    May St. Maria Goretti help\\tus  to\\tbe  pure  and  grant  us  the\\n    strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.\\n\\n    Saint Maria Goretti, pray for us.\\n\\n\\n    by Brendan Arthur\\n\\n-- \\nInternet: simon@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au  \\nViva Cristo Rey !!

I came out of a church in which even the different\\ncongregations were always competing and arguing about which one was\\nbetter and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything\\ninto practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, I\\'ve\\nfound that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they\\nare just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in\\nJanuary when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this\\nretreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even\\nthe people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple\\nthe previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One\\nof the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only\\none area in which disciples stand out from \"Christians\".  Also, another\\npart of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I\\'ve also been a part of\\nsome \"Christian\" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between\\nchurches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of\\nconviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be\\nunified, they didn\\'t care about the truth but delighted in getting along\\ntogether.\\n\\n>The problem here in The Netherlands is that there are two other churches\\n>(denominations) with the same characteristics. Both have the same\\n>confessions; there are only some differences with respect to - for\\n>example - the matter of appropriation of salvation and how to \"use\"\\n>our creeds. In essence a lot of people of these three churches have to\\n>same faith and feel that they should become one church. But how, that is\\n>the question.\\n>\\nCreeds?

Or is this definitely an untolerable situation\\n>  according to the Scriptures?\\n\\nAccording to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going\\nto be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those\\nwho teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion\\nand belief.  However, Scripture states:  \\n   In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your\\nmeetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when\\nyou come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some\\nextent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to\\nshow which of you have God\\'s approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).\\n\\nHow will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but\\nbefore that, there are these qualities:\\n   devotion to the apostles teaching\\n   fellowship\\n   communion\\n   filling with awe for God\\n   all having everything in common.\\n   glad and sincere hearts\\n   praising God\\n   enjoying the favor of the people\\nAll these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who\\nhave these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, \"a man full of\\nfaith and of the Holy Spirit\" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts\\n7:54-60).  \\n\\n>- can one say that only one of these three churches is the\\n>  true church of Jesus Christ?\\n\\nOne can say that a church is the true church only if that church is\\nperfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I\\nhave yet to find that, but the closest one I\\'ve found is the Boston\\nChurch of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors\\npointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I\\'ve seen which is\\ntotally sold out to God.\\n\\n>\\n>A problem closely related to these question is:\\n>- can we cooperate with other Christians - from these two churches - \\n>  before there is a unity? This question is especially important\\n>  for those who think that only one church can be the \"true one\".\\n>\\nAs for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand may\\nnever occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the\\n\"true one\", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are\\ndisciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they\\nwill not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I\\'ve heard\\nnumerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there\\nthat are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them\\nany less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they\\'ve ever run\\ninto someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement.\\nI know I haven\\'t.\\n\\n>Maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you.\\n>For your information: we have a lot of organizations here which\\n>are founded by people of one specific church and whose members\\n>are all members of that church.

A clique is a group which\\nruns around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems\\nin fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is\\nsomething \"correct\" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of\\nthe churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of\\npeople who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational\\nheads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of\\nthe committees and seldom were voted out of office without another\\noffice being \"opened up\" so that they would have to step right back in.\\nTheir degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he\\nnearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he\\nwould\\'ve since they still have no clue about what it means to be a\\ndisciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be\\nbroken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division\\nwithin.

A convert no less, attracted by the\\nrational tradition [Aquinas et al] and the emotional authenticity\\n[in comp. with the faddishness of Anglicanism] to Roman Catholicism. I\\nnever had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did, and\\ndo, believe in the sacremental system. I always felt quite happy to\\nlook down my nose at those such as John Emery [a few posts back] who\\nhad to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirely\\noblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [with\\nmiracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the\\nBible as God\\'s sole revelation, it was not very good logic to argue\\nthat the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God\\'s\\nrevelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, the\\nChurch that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestant\\nludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance\\nof Luther\\'s right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked.\\n\\tBut recently I read Peter Brown\\'s _Body and Society_. It is very\\nwell researched, and well written. But is raises some very upsetting\\nquestions. The early Christians were weird - even more so than today\\'s\\ncarzy fundies. They had odd views on sex, odder views on the body, \\ntotally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable\\nviews about other human beings. \\n\\tnow the question is this: were the first Christians just as\\nweird, but we\\'ve got used to them, or did the pristine \"Fall of the\\nChurch\" happen within one generation. It certainly did\\'nt have to\\nwait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so,\\nwha does  this say about God\\'s promise to always support the Church.\\nIt\\'s no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church\\nnot being an organization at me. It\\'s a community or it is nothing,\\nand it was the early communities that were weird. The institional\\nchurch was a model of sanity by comparison.\\n\\tI would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to\\nthis entirely serious issue. I\\'m not sure it is an issue for Protestants\\nwith their \"soul alone with Jesus\" approach, but for we who see the\\n\"ecclesia\" as a \"koinoia\" over time and space, the weird early\\nChristians are a problem.\\n\\n[This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view.  Many Protestants\\nhave a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  \"The soul\\nalone with God\" is certainly important for Protestants, but it\\'s by no\\nmeans the whole story.\\n\\nI have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out,\\nProtestants don\\'t have quite the same problem you do, because we\\nbelieve that the church had a Fall at some point.  However Protestant\\nmythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine (or\\nmore likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion,\\nstarting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated\\npower during the medieval period.)  The consequences of having it\\nearlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.  Most Protestants accept\\nthe theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including\\nsuch items as the Trinity and Incarnation.  Indeed in the works of\\nReformers such as Luther and Calvin, you\\'ll find Church Fathers such\\nas Augustine quoted all the time.  I think you\\'ll find many\\nProtestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was\\n\"wierd\".  (There is an additional problem for Protestants that I don\\'t\\nmuch want to talk about in this context, since it\\'s been looked at\\nrecently -- that\\'s the question of whether one can really think of\\nAugustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants.  Their views\\non Mary, the authority of the Pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to\\nProtestant thought.)\\n\\nOne thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology.\\nThere are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church.  What\\nconcerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see.  We\\nsee every Christian who courted martyrdom.  But I think there\\'s good\\nreason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than\\nthat.  We see the heroic virgins.  But I think there\\'s good reason to\\nthink that many Christians were happily married.  I can\\'t help\\nsuspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and\\nsane people that we do now.  I think there\\'s also a certain level of\\n\"revisionism\" active in history at the moment.  I don\\'t mean that\\nthey\\'re manufacturing things out of whole cloth.

I think many people would have preferred\\nto hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe\\neven from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather\\nthan from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a\\nperiod when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do\\nthink there was some written material earlier, which was probably used\\nas sources for the existing Gospels.\\n\\nEstablishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to\\nconfess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods\\nused.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64\\nAD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the\\nCentury.  A few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the\\nother.\\n\\n--clh]\\n\",\n",

I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to\\nread the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable\\nlack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really\\nsturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.\\n\\tThe point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith\\nof Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital\\nbeliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned -\\nthe Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church\\norganization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the\\nlived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one\\nhopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies\\nin the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.\\n\\tFollowing up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I \\nwould even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the\\nchristian life.

I would also recommend Graham Greene\\'s _Monsignor\\nQuixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch.

Do other texts\\ncontradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the\\nTrinity the most likely explanation after all?\\n\\nBut maybe I simply misunderstand their views.

Tucker\\t\\tKG2S\\t\\t     drt@athena.mit.edu|\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian\\nlanguage as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things\\nlike \"one essense and three persons\".  Obviously the three-fold\\nbaptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the\\nterm \"three-fold\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly\\nconsistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose\\nfull formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent\\'s.  It\\'s unlikely\\nthat Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine.\\nIndeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do\\nnot believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae\\noccurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in\\nthe name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as\\nwell.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we\\'re commanded in Mat.\\nto baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,\\nand in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.\\n\\n\"Jesus only\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this\\nconsistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of\\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I\\'m not the right one to\\nask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not\\nappear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of\\ndealing with the idiomatic phrase \"in the name of\".)\\n\\nThose who use the three-fold formula don\\'t seem to have a standard\\nanswer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus.\\nI suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \"in the name\\nof\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name\\nof Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus\\'\\nauthority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism\\nwith the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there\\'s a\\ncertain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we\\ncould just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn\\'t require the specific\\nthree-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes\\nbaptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\n\\nOne might well suspect that in the early church, more than one\\nbaptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to\\nbe the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great\\ndamage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that\\nI think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of\\nthe few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize\\nmutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in\\nthe interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that\\nthose groups that actually use \"in the name of Jesus\" now do seem to\\nhave in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I\\'ve said before, I\\'m\\nnot the one to explain what their doctrine is.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and\\n|> Computer Graphics World magazine.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n|> \\n|> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\\n|> companies,\\n|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\\n|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI\\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR\\n|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more\\ncompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having\\nevery point interact with every other point....but first read up on\\nlinear solutions to the n-body problem.\\n\\nThere are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on\\nsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

What is important is HOW they are used, and what \\n          else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )\\n\\n\\n          (1) THE 7-DAY FAST. \\n               1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind \\n          at a time, preferably grapes. \\n               2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half \\n          raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape \\n          clean the intestinal linings. \\n               3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice \\n          you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune \\n          juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from \\n          concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to \\n          your home bathroom.) \\n               4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and \\n          dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS \\n          CONTAIN LAETRILE.). \\n               5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from \\n          two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and \\n          add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).  \\n          Drink one glass per hour.\\n          [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day \\n          every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH \\n          PULP.] \\n               6th day: Same as 5th day. \\n               7th day: Same as 6th day. \\n               All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each \\n          day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements, \\n          plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \\n\\n          (2) THE GRAPE DIET. \\n               Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to \\n          8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the \\n          six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \\n      \\n          (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.\\n               Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple \\n          cider \"flavored\" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a \\n          glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.  \\n          Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a \\n          week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal \\n          healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially \\n          effective against those types of cancer that resemble a \\n          FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections. \\n        \\n          (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]\\n               Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level \\n          comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.  \\n          Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely \\n          dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt \\n          (regular salt won\\'t work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda. \\n               Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising \\n          your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your \\n          stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down, \\n          chomping your teeth together, etc.. \\n               Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes \\n          the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the \\n          book \"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\", by Frances Nixon, 1973. \\n               PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should \\n          prepare it and drain it.\\n          For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away \\n          from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly \\n          expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt \\n          other people\\'s fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at \\n          least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.  \\n          (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take \\n          a 2-Billion-bacteria \"Acidophilus\" capsule, which is also an \\n          EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \"A.I.D.S.\" \\n          (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the \\n          digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune \\n          system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal \\n          bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \"Lyme disease\".]\\n          Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder \\n          storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \"Major\" or \\n          \"Minor Periods\" as listed in the \"Solunar Tables\" published \\n          bimonthly in \"Field & Stream\" Magazine, (because of the \\n          measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields \\n          present at those times).\\n          Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year. \\n       \\n          (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES: \\n       \\n               For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the \\n               affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons \\n               per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for \\n               about 2 months. \\n        \\n               D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to \\n               perform NORMAL cell functions. \\n\\n               ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.  \\n               To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.  \\n               To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per \\n               day.\\n               [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.  \\n               IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer \\n               cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile \\n               into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is \\n               ALSO present in the digestive system.)] \\n\\n               ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include \\n               Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most \\n               people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A \\n               (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide \\n               Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up \\n               to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-\\n               toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime \\n               will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types), \\n               suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes, \\n               prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not \\n               cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST \\n               \"A.I.D.S.\", which is really a form of cancer similar to \\n               leukemia.]  (See the book \"Life Extension\", by Durk \\n               Pearson and Sandy Shaw.) \\n\\n               HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3% \\n               hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably \\n               DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day, \\n               hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.  \\n               Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers \\n               several times per day.\\n               Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good \\n               daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants \\n               described above. \\n\\n               VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and \\n               much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA \\n               doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources. \\n\\n               Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell) \\n               NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on \\n               and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an \\n               aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-\\n               radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with \\n               daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH \\n               magnetic fields. \\n\\n               Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES \\n               can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well \\n               as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics \\n               Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos \\n               of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays! \\n\\n               INTERFERON tablets.\\n\\n               TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho). \\n           \\n               HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical \\n               problems (even drug addiction!). \\n\\n               50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure \\n               prostate trouble. \\n\\n               This list is NOT exhaustive. \\n\\n\\n          The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-\\n          DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent \\n          and cure many other medical problems including heart-\\n          diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work \\n          effectively. \\n\\n          Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these \\n          remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send \\n          a strong message to one\\'s subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it \\n          to CURE the cancer. \\n\\n          In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer, \\n          then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies \\n          described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast), \\n          BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations \\n          and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer \\n          treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!]. \\n          \\n          \\n          DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources \\n          that have shown themselves to be reliable.

But every time I tried to \\nbring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus\\nand admonish me against converting to Judaism, \"because it involves\\ntoo much study and effort.\"  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor\\ntry to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly no\\nJewish proselytism going on there.\\n\\nAnd again, last November I toured a \"traditional\" Jewish synagogue and was\\nsubjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in\\ngeneral.  I realize that these are two isolated incidents, and that the\\nbest supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish, but from my experience,\\nthe modern Jew is not known for his proselytism.\\n\\n \\n-- \\nboundary\\n\\nno teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no he\\nvenido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo 10:34, Vulgata Latina) \\n',\n",

On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal\\ncarried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \"Armed Force.\"  I\\nfelt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat\\nthat \"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\"  I sent\\nthe following to the WSJ.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nGun Stats & Mortal Risks\\n\\nPreston K. Covey\\n\\n\\n\\tErik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~\\n2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns\\nin the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King\\nCounty, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more\\nlikely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to\\nkill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it\\nhas grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated\\nby one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of\\nthe finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine\\n(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping\\nfirearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ \\n \\n\\tResponsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of\\nbringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: \\nWhat exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither\\nthe whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the\\nrisks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control\\ndo we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of\\ncancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the\\nrisks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful\\nhere. \\n\\n\\tThe NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us\\noff.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a\\nmisleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice\\nand terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far\\noutweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your\\ncar were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or\\nan innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not\\ntake the bus?  \\n\\n\\tUncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company\\nof lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at\\nstake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:\\n\\n\\tThe ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the\\nnumber of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense\\n(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed\\nby a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation\\nis 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other\\ncases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12\\naccidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided\\nby 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King\\nCounty between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of\\nhomes unaccounted.\\n\\n\\tThe NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on\\nsix counts:\\n\\n\\t1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or\\nacquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and\\nneighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is\\nthat the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,\\ndear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,\\nbut the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are\\nrelevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the\\ncalculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless\\nWaltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is\\ncriminological hogwash.\\n\\n\\t2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs\\npopulated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories\\n-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited\\nby more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities\\nlike drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is\\nvery low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but\\navoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with\\nhistories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and\\ncertifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious\\nrisk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as\\nignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither\\ngun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or\\nvehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver\\ncrucially affect the risk. \\n\\n\\t3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is\\nthat the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill\\nthan to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of\\npersonal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike\\nLarson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43\\ntimes as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun\\nViolence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this\\nparticular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about\\nwhether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by\\ntautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question\\nbegged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any\\ncase, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal\\ninstruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths\\nare personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility\\nobviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by\\ngun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to\\nNEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. \\nPeople have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their\\nhomes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection\\ncourse do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and\\nsober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death\\nas do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard\\nand obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they\\ndisregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and\\nother risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we\\nresent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose\\nnorms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign\\nus to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in\\nthe matter.\\n\\n\\t4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the\\nNEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,\\nincluding those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total\\ndeath toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other\\nstudies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from\\nhomicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these\\nsuicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true\\nthat attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously\\ntrue that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these\\nsuicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of\\nresearch on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is\\nwishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce\\nL. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,\\n1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of\\nPsychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of\\nthe NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to\\n~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the\\ncauses, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a\\nprofoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally\\ndisregard this issue.\\n\\n\\t5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable\\nrate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the\\nNEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. \\nBut many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled\\nself-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case\\ndispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of\\njustifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story\\non women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women\\nwho appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,\\n1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic\\ncases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were\\nreported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported\\nthat 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In\\nTime~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error\\nby a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged\\nby promulgators of the NEJM statistic. \\n\\n\\t6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation\\nare arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The\\ndivisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not\\naggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even\\nshot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the\\ncoin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy\\nis it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure\\nthe utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as\\nopposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or\\ndeterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where\\nno human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed\\nto media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the\\ncompendious research on successful armed defense, notably by\\ncriminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,\\nAldine de Gruyter, 1992)?\\n\\tKleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are\\nbased on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is\\nhigh (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare\\nbetter than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance\\nor those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year\\nby 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and\\naccidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable\\nstatistic than the NEJM scare stat:  \\n\\nA gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or\\nother crime than to kill anybody.   \\n\\n\\tOf course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;\\nwhat is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We\\nshould indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation\\nof defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. \\nClearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by\\nuncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we\\ncan hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we\\nhardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.\\n\\n-- \\nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com\\n',\n",

It is \"obvious\"ly wrong to\\nbe angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angry\\nwhich is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us\\nfor putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was \"forgive\\nthem Father, they know not what they do.\"  Knowing how forgiving Jesus\\nhas been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of\\nlove for Him.  Please don\\'t give in to anger, it will only cause\\nfoolish quarrels and more bad feelings.\\n\\nIt\\'s okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to\\naddress it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out\\nthere was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with\\nAIDS because they deserve punishment that others don\\'t then I would\\nframe a response something like this:\\n\\n\"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is\\nsimply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God\\'s punishment\\nfor people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his\\nchildren equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We\\nwill all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the\\nopportunity to accept God\\'s grace by earnestly seeking after him with\\nall of our hearts, believing the gospel\\'s testimony, repenting of our\\nsin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life\\nfor him.\\n Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God\\'s arm is not\\nto short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart\\nor a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through\\nthe worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men\\nthat they may perhaps reach out and find him.\"\\n\\nThe second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears\\nof people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is\\nactually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the\\nearlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven\\'t been\\nexpressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your\\nperceptions, but please try to be open-minded.\\n\\nYou are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people\\nbecause they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and\\nI do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the\\ncity and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some\\nbrothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so\\nthat you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.\\n\\nThe third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual\\ncontracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their\\nsalvation in that there may be repetence involved.\\n\\nThe important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God\\'s\\ncommands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or\\nmisfortune to yourself and others.

If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but\\nactually no existing being could give an answer. \\n\\nImagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also\\nask: \"Why nothing exists?\" This is equivalent to my counter-question,\\n\"why nothing exists in nothingness\". \\n\\nNow, \"why anything exists\" is equivalent to \"why something exists in\\nsomethingness\".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies\\nfor the poor wording in my previous post.\\n\\n> I might add, the worldview of \"Things that exist do, and things that\\n> don\\'t...don\\'t\" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable,\\n> as does the theist\\'s belief in God.

Of course, this is only the beginning for his\\nprogram.\\n\\nIn my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic\\nsymptoms outlined in \\'The Yeast Connection\\' (I agree it is a poorly \\nwritten book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which\\nI never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage\\nof Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can\\nnow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I\\'m also\\n*greatly* improved in other areas as well.\\n\\nOf course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to\\nmolds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn\\'t take a rocket scientist to figure out that\\nif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a\\nnatural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you\\nwould have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various\\nsorts, and again, you don\\'t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that\\nsuch toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus\\nsince that\\'s the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000\\nquestion is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was\\nfrom over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the\\nstress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast\\ncolonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since\\ntesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to\\ntake an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively\\nsafe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there\\'s\\nno reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.\\n\\nBTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae\\ntoo deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.

Some people really have heard God, and others\\nheard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  He\\nsaid someone told him, \"The Lord gave me a song.\"  He said that it was\\nthe worst song he had ever heard.\\n\\n\"I know why he gave you that song,\" Murillo said, \"He didn\\'t want it anymore.\"\\n\\nBut God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to the\\nidea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit\\nin the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first\\nto put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one\\nwe have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  \\n\\nMany prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures.\\nFor example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an \"M\" who\\nprophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy\\nhe gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies\\nbecause the king complained before he heard the prophecy, \"He never prophesies\\nanything good about me.\"  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his \\nlifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples.\\nBarnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an \\napostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two of\\nAgabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophet\\nbefore he gave them.  \\n\\nSo prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it \\nScripture.  \\n\\n>Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new\\n>but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call\\n>that prophecy?  Misleading?  Wouldn\\'t that be more having to do with\\n>knowledge?\\n\\nI don\\'t know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with \\nprophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also \\nsimilar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets prophecies\\nin a seemingly prophetic way, for example, \"And his bishoprick let another\\ntake\" concerning Judas office.\\n\\nA clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying about\\nwhat will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel\\nabout the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scriptural\\nprophecy can be used in later prophecy.  \\n\\nSometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,\\nbut gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom\\ncan overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.  \\nInterpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often\\nconsidered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a \\nbit hazy.  Imho, it doesn\\'t usually matter that much if we are able to\\nlabel a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the \\nSpirit, and use them according to His leading.\\n\\nLink Hudson.\\n',\n",

So here it comes:\\n\\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\\ndoesn\\'t check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \\nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\\n\\n The result of this process is the following:\\n  \\n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren\\'t performed.\\n\\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\\n        there was room on the disk.\\n\\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG\\'s (1200x900 and bigger) can be\\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\\n\\n\\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\\ntable? I can\\'t remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\\nsort a directory listing?\\n\\n\\nWith much thanks to the originator of this article.\\n +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+\\n |        Rene Walter          |          renew@stack.urc.tue.nl           |\\n +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+\\n | \"Will I drown in tears of sorrow, Is there hope for tomorrow,           |\\n |  Will this world ever get better, Can\\'t we all just live together       |\\n |  I don\\'t wanna live in strife  , I just wanna live my life              |\\n |  I deserve to have a future...\"                                         |\\n |                                     -The Good Girls    \"Future\"         |\\n +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+\\n\\n',\n",

Some say that if the two have\\n: publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and\\n: are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective\\n: qualifier) they are married/joined in God\\'s sight.\\n\\nThe way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically*\\nmarried, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.\\n\\ne.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall\\nleave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh\\'\\'\\n(Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).\\n\\nIf you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the\\nphraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife\\'\\'. This\\nimplies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the\\npoint of intercourse.\\n\\nCompare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary\\nwas pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were\\n*betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which\\nrequired a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary\\nand Joseph went to bed together.\\n\\nCompare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is\\ndescribed as the ``bride\\'\\' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes \\nplace when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with\\nJesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will\\ntake place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse,\\nbecause it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.\\n\\nIn summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is\\nnot marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the\\npoint when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don\\'t mean to demean the\\ncivil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don\\'t mean to be too pedantic.)\\nHistorically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a\\nmarriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since\\nNapoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I\\'m ready to be\\ncorrected on that point!)\\n\\nThis view obviously raises some questions:\\n\\nWhat about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering\\nmarriage. Are those people also ``married\\'\\'?\\n\\nIf it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary\\nto be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours\\nthe laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep\\ntogether though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God-\\nhonouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before\\nactually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and\\nalso to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive\\nto declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)\\n\\n-- \\n\\n-----\\nMichael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)\\n\\n\\tAnd hast thou slain the Jabberwock?\\n\\tCome to my arms, my beamish boy!\\n',\n",

The 80 series Colt\\'s for\\nexample are quite safe to carry this way.\\n\\n> - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\\n>   operation of many of them requires more training.\\n\\nAgreed.\\n\\nNow that I\\'ve shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It\\nis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn\\'t cost you much.  On\\nthe other hand, I\\'ve had all sorts of interesting things happen over the\\nyears.  For example, I\\'ve had FACTORY ammunition that has had high\\nprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds\\nto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.\\nAn auto?  Jack the slide and continue.\\n\\nI\\'ve had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from\\nturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen\\nwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.\\n\\nMost revolvers are more \\'fragile\\' then semi auto\\'s.  There are all sorts\\nof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a\\nblow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many\\nof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto\\ntake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely\\nto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you\\'re out of the fight.\\nThe majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall\\ninto that category.\\n\\nVincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing\\nview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob\\'s \"The Semi\\nAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\"\\n\\nIn general, I\\'d agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination\\nthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi\\nauto effectively as a self defense arm.\\n\\nMost cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department\\nisn\\'t going to train them, they aren\\'t going to take the time on their\\nown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of\\ntraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several\\ntimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don\\'t bother.\\n\\nFor myself, I\\'d hate to be limited to one or the other.  I\\'d rather pick\\nwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I\\'m wearing that day\\nand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!\\n\\nThat said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of\\nbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a\\nRuger or Smith revolver....

We use it to\\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\\nvideo to the Net.\\n\\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\\n\\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces \"near VHS\" quality at 30 fields per\\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\\nfind distracting.\\n\\nIf you can get past this problem, you\\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing \\nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\\n\\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\\'ve ever\\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\\'ll recognize the methodology\\nand the user interface.\\n\\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21\" Apple mon-\\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\\n\\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\\nwill look better.\\n\\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.
